In the present edition of KRITERION Rosmarie Creutzig critizises
Vordereggers Nietzsche interpretation. Thorsten Niehaus analyses the concept
of necessity from a historical and systematical point of view.

KRITERION is now typesetted in LATEX2e. LATEX2e is a very powerful
macropackage for typesetting TEX, device independent, and available for
free as a public domain software. It provides a suitable possibility to
produce scientific publications of high typographical quality,
especially those containing complicated mathematical or logical symbols.
As a consequence new guidelines for the authors have been devised that
focus mainly on the citations.

With the present edition of KRITERION not only the abstracts, but also
the full papers in form of *.pdf und *.ps files will be accessible for
free at http: // ccd. ufwlctipd. ct .

Table of Contents: Volume 16
- Rosmarie CREUTZIG: Ontology, Metaphysics and Nihilism. Essay on
Jüngerman and Vorderegger.
- Thorsten NIEHAUS: Der Begriff der Notwendigkeit in der Antike und in der
Gegenwart
- Richtlinien für Autoren
- Guidelines for Authors

3) We are always interested in new articles in English or German handed
in for publication. Please refer to our website for details.
