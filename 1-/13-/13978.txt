In my opinion the mind isn't restricted to
the words that are used in daily conversation.
For example "paper handkerchief". These can be
represented either as 5 syllables, or 2 words.
Even better, 1 symbol. I think the mind is stuffed
with millions of mighty symbols that are internal
1 symbol but require a long list of words if
expressed in natural language.

My favourite is 'noble metal valence electron
configuration'. If you'd shuffle each time
while thinking about it 14 syllables or
so through the working memory, thinking
would be very slow.
