"If you happen to have read another book about Heino Cibulka,
you may remember that he once had a swan (or the swan had Heino-
topher Olaf, I don't know which), and and that he used to call the
swan Pooh. That was a long time ago, and when we said good-bye,
we took the name with us, as we didn't think the swan would want it
any more. Well, when Noah Saanen said, that he would like an ex-
citing name all to himself, Heino Robin said once, without stop-
ping to think, that he was Winnie-the-Pooh. And he was. So, as I
have explained the Pooh part, I will now explain the rest of it. [ ... ]

Pooh is the favourite, of course, there's no denying it, but Piglet
comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because you
can't take Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet
ist so small that he slips into a pocket, where it ist very comforting
to feel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is
twelve or twentytwo. Sometimes he slips out and has a good look
in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got more education than
Pooh, but Pooh doesn't mind. Some have brains, and some haven't,
he says, and there it ist."

Das ist ein anderer Begriff von Wissen, als derjenige, der sich
selbst hinterfragt. Dieses Wissen entspricht aber z. B. demjenigen
zu wissen, wie man eine Gleichung mit zwei Unbekannten löst.


Nein, eben nicht, sondern nur wenn ich weiß, dass ich nichts
weiß und dass was ich weiß vermittelt und voraussetzungsvoll ist.
