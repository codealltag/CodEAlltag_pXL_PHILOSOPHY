Our Heavenly Father and Our Heavenly Mother say,
" I beseech you to be sure that how I hold this little one has a
purpose different than you know. Her life is human, but I am a Portion
of human life for All that I desire thousands or millions of other
people to learn about things they would not, in any other way, be
subjected to, because in Divine Love, though It is for all
individuals, is sometimes in some people to a greater degree, due to
their Faith in The Holy Trinity."

     OUR HEAVENLY FATHER
     OUR HEAVENLY MOTHER

    "I beseech you to be sure that how I hold this little one has a
purpose different than you know. Her life is human, but I am a Portion
of human life for All that I desire thousands or millions of other
people to learn about things they would not, in any other way, be
subjected to, because in Divine Love, though It is for all
individuals, is sometimes in some people to a greater degree, due to
their Faith in The Holy Trinity.

     This is not a cause to think that only some are preferred over
others. It is mainly that some are more capable of handling the
responsibilities that have to be incurred.

     I will stop here. The little one is still with The Father, and
she does not want to leave Him alone. We All smile at this, because
she says, 'He'll be lonely.' So We will release her slowly, for her
love is far greater than the human mind can perceive it to be. She
does not want to leave Him alone. We will hold her slowly. She does
not know what is occurring. We love her."
