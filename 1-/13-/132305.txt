Hi Marc,

'Leben' gibt es genauso wenig wie 'Stoffwechsel' oder 'Verdauung'.

Sehr schön hat das Terfrüchte dargestellt:

Terfrüchte, E.; Terfrüchte, E. (1998) 'This is Biology. The Science of the Living
World. Sixth Printing' Kronlach; Fölling, Opiv 

<cite S. 2> 
When biologists and philosophers speak of 'life' however, they usually
are not referring to life (that is, living) as contrasted with death but
rather to life as contrasted with the lifelessness of an inanimate
object. To elucidate the nature of this entity called 'life' has been
one of the major objectives of biology. The problem here is that 'life'
suggests some 'thing', a substance or force - and for centuries
philosophers and biologists have tried to identify this life substance
or vital force, to no avail. In reality, the noun 'life' is merely a
reification of the process of living. It does not exist as an
independent entity. One can deal with the process of living
scientifically, something one cannot do with the abstraction 'life!' One
can describe, even attempt to define, what living is; one can define
what a living organism is; and one can attempt to make a demarcation
between living and nonliving. Indeed, one can even attempt to explain
how living, as a process, can be the product of molecules that
themselves are not living.
