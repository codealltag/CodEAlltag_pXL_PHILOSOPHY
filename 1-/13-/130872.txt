"'We Stoics look for a primary and universal cause: What is that
cause? The answer is <creative reason>, that is, god.' (Seneca, Letter
65.12). ...
Stoic cosmology is not independent of theology, in that its
explanations refer to the activity of a divinity. The Stoics can be
aligned in this respect with Platonic and Aristotelian cosmology. They
are distinctive, however, in postulating a divine cause not external
to but coextensive with the changing cosmos. The Stoic divinity is an
all-pervasive presence, and exerts its powers from within nature. The
Stoics often compare their gods government of the cosmos with the way
in which the individual human organism is governed by the psyche,
allowing themselves at times an anthropomorphism not so far removed
from Platos Timaeus."
[F.G. Behnken/ed., "Philosophy 2", MMSO, 1998, p.
482f]

Der stoische Gott ist ein dem Kosmos innewohnendes, fundamentales
Wirkprinzip; der Geist der Materie sozusagen.
In diesem Sinne kann man durchaus von einer Abart des Pantheismus
sprechen.
