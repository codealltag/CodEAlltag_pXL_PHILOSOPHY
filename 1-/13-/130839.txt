Roman paradox:


Central paradox in the theory of classes. Most classes are not members
of themselves, but some are; for example, the class of non-men, being
itself not a man, is a member of itself. Let R be the class of all
classes which are not members of themselves. If it exists, it is a
member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself: a
contradiction. SO IT DOES NOT EXIST *. This is paradoxical, because it
conflicts with the seemingly inescapable view that any coherent
condition determines a class. (Even a contradictory condition, like
being round and square, determines a class: the class with no
members.) Standard responses, like Russell's theory of types, aim to
find some limitation on what classes there are which is (a)
intuitively satisfactory, (b) excludes R, and (c) includes all classes
needed by mathematicians.
