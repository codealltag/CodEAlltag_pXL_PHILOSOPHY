While I agree with the statements above,
for the German AI Forthmind I need to
keep entering useful German words into the
http://stqt.mikitz.rmf/r/kawsdaiew/ccab/LuXlka
bootstrap sequence. A German word is an =93internal
1 symbol=94 but the recognition of the acoustic
or written word is required to activate the symbol.

While adding more German words today, I
made a pleasant discovery in the matter of
how to handle irregular German nouns. I
suddenly realized what to do with the
German word =93der Mensch=94 for =93human being.=94

We can say =93The human knows you=94 in German
with =93Der Mensch kennt dich,=94 but to say
=93You know the human,=94 we have to say,
=93Du kennst den Menschen.=94 Today I
realized that my German DeBoot sequence
needs only to store only the nominative case
for regular German nouns, plus the accusative
case for an irregular noun like =93der Mensch=94.
The HauptWort noun-phrase module will
use nominatives and accusatives interchangeably,
unless an irregular like =93Mench=94 forces a default.

The above may sound esoteric and over-detailed,
but I am working hard!
