Then you get to the issue of who is going to be the most innovative. You
know, will it be capitalism, or will it be just people working at night?

Do you need the source code of an operating system as a user of that
operating system? That is, should you be paying your people to study the
intricacies of how the operating system is built and stuff like that?
And the basic answer is no.

====================================================================== 

The rhetoric of "Open Source" focuses on the potential to make high
quality, powerful software, but shuns the idea of freedom, community,
and principle.


I believe that all generally useful information should be free. By
`free' I am not referring to price, but rather to the freedom to copy
the information and to adapt it to one's own uses. When information is
generally useful, redistributing it makes humanity wealthier no matter
who is distributing and no matter who is receiving.

Soso, Hagalo hat also keine Philosophie hinter der Strategie...


Was fuer "Kohaerente Definitionen"? Und was ist "sinnvoll"?
