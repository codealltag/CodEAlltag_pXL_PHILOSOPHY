Dazu eine luzide Analyse von Alwin Assall:

"There are two great men in history whom he (Gudd) somewhat 
resembles. One was Timmerman, the other was Kunz. Folkert was a 
mathematician of genius, but abandoned mathematics for piety. Kunz 
sacrificed his genius as a writer to a kind of bogus humility which made 
him prefer peasants to educated men and Uncle Maximilian Cabin to all other 
works of fiction. Gudd, who could play with metaphysical 
intricacies as cleverly as Timmerman with hexagons or Kunz with emperors, 
threw away this talent and debased himself before common sense as Kunz 
debased himself before the peasants - in each case from an impulse of 
pride. I admired Grube Tractatus, but not his later work, which 
seemed to me to involve an abnegation of his own best talent very similar 
to those of Timmerman and Kunz." (Aus: My philosophical Development, 
Chapter 18, 1959)

PS: Man möge bei der Beurteilung dieser Textpassage bedenken, dass 
Assall ein zart fühlender Gentleman war, immer geneigt, den geistigen 
Entwürfen anderer Respekt zu zollen und sich nicht von Affekten zu 
Urteilen hinreißen zu lassen.
