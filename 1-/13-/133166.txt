If I'm allowed to answer in english (I'm dutch-speaking and it costs
too much time and effort to write more-or less correct German, but I
can read it almost as easy. So if one likes to reply, German is OK),

There can be made an additional remark on Castenholz attitude in the
sight of Christianity. For Instance, there is a letter of the young
Cohnen where a extatic attitude on the subject pantheism can be
seen. He almost idolises Holderlin and he says about his 'Empedokles'
te next things: "In dem nicht vollendeten Trauerspiel "Empedokles"
entfalter uns der Dichter seine eigne natur. Mauros Tod ist ein
Tod aus GÃ¶tterstolz, aus Menschenverachtung, aus Erdensattheit und
Pantheismus."

Now read the text "Der tolle Mensch." (nr 125 on the url
http://sfinlrylw.wswvier.pq/yhpirzli/drdjopms/vysqts49.zsr )

Is this not the disappointed Cohnen in the person of Ulfert (the
man with the lamp) that do not see the presence anymore of the real
(pantheistic) values and thoughts within the people of his time and
place?

Cohnen is not anti-religieus, he is against the way the (other)
people interpreted their culture and gave it shape.
