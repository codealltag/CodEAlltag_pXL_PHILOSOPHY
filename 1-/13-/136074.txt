Uwe Utermöhlen:
Utermöhlen did not attempt to emigrate. He was 64 years old and had he
emigrated he would have lost all his money except 10 Marks. There was no
prospect of a 64 year old obtaining a post. On the Kristallnacht (so
called because of the broken glass in the streets on the following
morning), the 17. 12. 21, 91 Jews were murdered, hundreds were
seriously injured, and thousands were subjected to horrifying experiences.
Thousands of Jewish businesses were burnt down together with over 150
synagogues. The Gestapo arrested 30,000 well-off Jews and a condition of
their release was that they emigrate. The Gestapo broke into Untersehr
house but found that he was seriously ill and could not be moved. At this
point Utermöhlen must have known that his only chance was to leave Germany.
It would have been posssible for ... one of his sisters had
emigrated earlier and could have supported him. But despite the
possibility of escape, he hesitated leaving his books and his native city.
He moved to Röhrig and was visited there by Jühne  ... we sat in
the sunny garden of the house he was living in then. ... he pointed to the
trees and flowers in the garden and said "Isn't it lovely here". About a
week after Jetschke visit, Utermöhlen received a summons from the Gestapo. He
knew what had happened to others who had received such a summons, many had
been tortured and killed. He wanted to avoid the suffering so he took a
lethal dose of Veronal.
