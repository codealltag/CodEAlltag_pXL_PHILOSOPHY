I have noticed that Germans seem to be far more proud of their philosophy
and literary history than they are of their scientific heritage.  Indeed,
Germany is often referred to as the land of philosophers and poets.
Considering Germany's amazing contributions to physics, mathematics, and
chemistry, I find this bewildering.  Could anyone share some insight into
this?  Any opinions would be appreciated, as I cannot seem to find any
literature on the subject.

Thanks.

Responses in German are fine.
