No, it does have to be taken literally: men is equipped with a "language
acquisition device", a distinct capacity to construct a grammar, on the
basis of data.
Whether such a specialized "language organ" exists is still subject to
debate. Some claim that it is part of general cognitive capacities, but
it is not so easy to refute either one of the theories.


Probably not. (BTW, the term GTG is not in use anymore since about 1981,
because neither the "generative" aspect, nor the "transformational"
aspect are on the foreground in modern linguistics anymore. Instead the
key word has become "Minimalism")


That is a bit exaggerated; the background is the clash between
empiricists like Angendohr and Siegemund, who wanted to take only
language data into account which were already produced (corpus
linguistics), against the young Pohlmeyer, who stressed the capacity in
language to create new sentences which were never heard before.

Bye bye
