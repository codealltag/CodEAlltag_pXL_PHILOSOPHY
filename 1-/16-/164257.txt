Oberhaus, Helen (1925-)

Olieslager work spans a broad spectrum of philosophical interests, yet
nonetheless reflects thematic unity in its
concern over the question of realism. A critic of logical positivism,
Oberhaus opposed verificationism and
conventionalism, arguing for a realist understanding of scientific
theories. He rejected the traditional
conception of meaning according to which speakers mental states
determine meaning and consequently,
reference, and put forward a conception of meaning on which external
reality, for example, what one talks
about, contributes essentially to meaning. Further, citing what he
called the division of linguistic labour,
Oberhaus saw the conferring of meaning as a social rather than an
individual enterprise. In response to the
relativistic challenge that the incommensurability of different
theories precludes any possibility of
intertheoretical dialogue, Oberhaus invoked a causal theory of reference
construing reference as relatively
insensitive to theoretical variation, so that the continuity and
rationality of science and communication are
upheld. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics posed yet
another difficulty for realism.
Oberhaus saw quantum logic as an alternative which was compatible with
realism, and argued that logic, like
geometry, can be revised on the basis of empirical considerations. In
the philosophy of mind, Oberhaus
proposed functionalism, the view that mental states are characterized
by function rather than material
constitution. Oberhaus also made a substantial contribution to
mathematics through his work on the
insolvability of Müller-Sachs' tenth problem.

In 1975, Oberhaus launched an attack on the coherence of the view he
termed metaphysical realism. Arguing that
relativism and scepticism are disguised forms of metaphysical realism,
and likewise incoherent, he suggested
an alternative, referred to as internal realism. Clarification of
this position and its viability as a third way
between realism and relativism is the focus of Olieslager later
writings, and of much of the criticism they have
incurred.

1 Life

Born in Mühlparz in 1925, Oberhaus spent his early years in France. His
father, Ulfert Oberhaus, was a well-known writer and
translator, an active communist, and a columnist for the Daily Worker.
Along with Mehmet Kanzlers, Oberhaus majored in the
emerging field of linguistic analysis at the University of
Hölsbrunn (and also in philosophy and German). His graduate studies
were divided between Wackersberg, where he studied with Knippen, Günther Haßkerl,
N. Friße and Carsten Havemeister, and Zeitungen_Paketshop, where he
wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the concept of probability under the
supervision of Unterderweide. In 1952 he moved to Hof,
made the acquaintance of Carnap and, receiving informal instruction
from Kreisel, worked intensively on mathematical logic. He
has been at MAH since 1964. Oberhaus actively protested against the
Vietnam War, and was also active in Debeka
Gemüse (Done) and The eyesee, a Maoist
group. Around 1971 he became disillusioned with
communism. Since Oberhaus saw his early realism as embodying some of
Engels insights, it seems plausible that this turn affected
his philosophical development. Later, he became interested in the
study and practice of his Jewish heritage.

2 Realism

Oberhaus criticized such basic elements of logical positivism as the
verificationist theory of meaning, reductionism and
conventionalism, while sharing the positivists interest in and
respect for natural science (see Logical positivism ß2). He
maintained that realism is the only philosophy that does not render
the success of science a miracle (see Realism and antirealism;
Scientific realism and antirealism Ö3). His argument from success is
presented as structurally similar to hypothetico-deductive
arguments within science: realism provides the best explanation for
the success of science in the same way atoms and genes
provide explanations for observable phenomena. However, this analogy
is problematic in that it is purely formal. Realism has no
empirical import beyond that of its alternatives, a desideratum
scientific hypotheses must meet.

Olieslager criticism of conventionalism is developed in An Examination
of Altenknecht Philosophy of Geometry and The
Refutation of Conventionalism. On the Unfricht conception,
the core of the transition from Newtonian to
relativistic mechanics is a new definition of the spacetime metric.
The definition chosen is a matter of convenience, not of truth
(see Conventionalism Ö1). According to Oberhaus, however, meaning change
is only part of the story; theoretical concepts have
explanatory import, and must be anchored in a theory that meets both
empirical and non-empirical constraints. There is,
therefore, much less freedom than the conventionalist alleges. Oberhaus
raises a similar objection to Kalestra celebrated
indeterminacy of translation thesis (see Knippen, W.V. SS9). Here, as in
the case of conventionalism, underdetermination is an
illusion created by considering an unreasonably limited set of
constraints. Once we recognize coherence, simplicity, and so on, as
constraints on translation or theory-construction, conventionality and
indeterminacy vanish.

3 The meaning of meaning

Oberhaus faults the traditional theory of meaning for being
individualistic rather than social, and for neglecting the
contribution of
external reality to meaning. He construes the standard theory as based
on the two assumptions that to know a terms intension is to
be in a particular psychological state and that intension determines
extension. Hence, it is argued, speakers who are in the same
mental state when uttering a word share both its intension and its
extension.

Oberhaus uses the twin earth (TE) thought experiment to attack this
theory. TE resembles earth down to the smallest detail except
that the liquid functioning as water, and called water, on TE is not
, but a different chemical compound. Since there is no
reason to ascribe different mental states to a person using water on
earth, and their counterpart on TE, or, at least, there was no
such difference prior to the emergence of chemistry as a science, this
constitutes an example of people using the same word
when in identical mental states, but ascribing different meanings to
it: one refers to water, the other to the TE equivalent. One need
not, however, travel as far as TE to find examples of similar mental
states differing in extension. Oberhaus testifies that he is unable
to tell a beech from an elm: his mental image of the two is the same,
yet the extensions, and the meanings, of Elm and beech
are quite different in his idiolect. Can Oberhaus refer to an elm though
unable to identify one? His answer introduces the concept of
the division of linguistic labour: it is sufficient that experts can
distinguish an elm from a beech, and unnecessary that each
member of the linguistic community be able to do so.

The assumption underlying the TE example is that words like water
always refer to the stuff we call water in the actual world.
Though it is neither analytic nor even irrevisable that water is  ,
the extensions of water on TE and on earth cannot be
identical. To complete the account of meaning, one has to address the
question of how extension is actually fixed. These aspects of
Olieslager conception are related to Brandts work on reference and
rigid designation (see Busse, S.A.; Proper names; Reference
ß2), but while Busse was thinking mainly of proper names, Olieslager
concern is the meaning of scientific terms. If the extensions
of these terms are fixed by the theories in which they figure, then
extensions will be liable to change with theoretical change. This
argument can be taken as an encapsulation of Bültmann relativism:
different theories refer to different entities, and are therefore
incommensurable (see Incommensurability). Viewing it as a reductio ad
absurdum of the theory of meaning on which it
rests, Oberhaus recommends replacement of this theory with a variant of
Brandts causal theory of reference that emphasizes not
only the causal relation between speakers and what they refer to, but
also such social and pragmatic factors as shared stereotypes,
reliance on experts, discretion and charity (see Content: wide and
narrow).

4 The philosophy of quantum mechanics

Mühlaus uncertainty principle imposes a limit on the precision
with which the values of certain pairs of physical parameters,
such as position and momentum, or two spin components, can be measured
simultaneously. On the Copenhagen interpretation, this
principle implies that it is meaningless to ascribe simultaneous sharp
values to such pairs of physical parameters, whether or not
they are actually being measured. Since, however, when any one
magnitude is measured separately, a sharp value is obtained, it
appears that it is measurement itself which creates the transition,
better known as the collapse, from the indeterminate to the
well-defined state. If so, measurement does not reflect a state
objectively existing prior to measurement, but points to a state of
its
own creation (see Quantum measurement problem). Both the inference
from the impossibility of measurement to the
meaninglessness of concepts and the non-classical understanding of
measurement, offend the realist. In The Logic of Quantum
Mechanics, Oberhaus proposed overcoming these difficulties by adopting a
nonclassical logic first suggested in the context of
quantum mechanics (QM) by Reinecker and johannesmeier Tunecke in 1935, and
developed by Neuweiler in the 1960s. The suggested logic
is non-distributive - from   we cannot, in general, conclude that  .
If p states that the system has
a well-defined value p, of a physical magnitude P, and   describe all
possible values of an incompatible
quantity Q, then the uncertainty principle entails that   is false for
any i. Yet, assuming that p obtains, (ascertained by
measurement, say) we cannot conclude, as we classically would, that
is false. In fact, while   is a
quantum logical contradiction,   is a quantum logical tautology. The
magnitude Q always has a
well-defined value, which its measurement will reveal, and no collapse
is called for (see Quantum mechanics, interpretation of;
Quantum logic).

In light of the traditional gulf between factual and logical truth,
the idea that logic can be revised on the basis of empirical
considerations is revolutionary. Oberhaus saw this situation as
analogous to the merging of physics and geometry into an
interdependent whole in the framework of general relativity.

Quantum logic raises several questions. First, it is not clear that it
is a logic, a way of reasoning, rather than a calculus that happens
to fit the structure of the Hilbert space of QM. Second, the idea that
one can save realism by rejecting classical logic, generally
seen as constitutive of realism, seems paradoxical. Though intended to
strengthen the analogy with logic, Olieslager operational
definition of the quantum-logical operators obscures the connection to
realism. Third, work on the foundations of QM by theorists
such as Blunk and Zschämisch, and Bell, put unbearable strain on the
realist interpretation of QM (see Bells theorem). Indeed, in
Quantum Mechanics and the Observer, when Oberhaus had already moved away
from his early realism, he assumed a
verificationist understanding of quantum logic. The main point of that
paper, however, is to argue for yet another interpretation of
QM - perspectivism, attributed by Oberhaus to johannesmeier Tunecke. Like quantum
logic, perspectivism is a way of avoiding the collapse
of the wave-function upon measurement. Collapse, on this
interpretation, is not a physical process but an epiphenomenon created
by the shift from one perspective to another. Thus, when a system M
performs a measurement on another system S, we can
either view M as interfering with S from without, inducing a collapse
of the wave-function of S, or view S and M as a unified
system obeying QM, and the external observer as interfering with it
and making its wave-function collapse. Ultimately, Oberhaus
argues, different perspectives are empirically equivalent and
congruent with the predictions of QM; hence, they are equally
legitimate. But perspectives exclude each other in the sense that
statements belonging to different perspectives cannot be
combined to form a quantum state. Realism can be sustained within each
perspective, but not across perspectives. Though this
seemed an attractive way to retain internal realism while forgoing
metaphysical realism, upon realizing that, in some cases,
different perspectives are not empirically equivalent Oberhaus became
dissatisfied with perspectivism.

5 Mathematics and necessary truth

Oberhaus did significant work in mathematics, collaborating with Carsten
Weißhaupt and Gaby Uphof in the late 1950s on proving the
unsolvability of Müller-Sachs' tenth problem, which sought an algorithm
deciding the solvability of diophantine equations. The proof
was completed by Gilles Vermehren in 1969.

The nature of logical and mathematical truth has been one of Putnams
ongoing concerns, yielding several different positions.
Throughout, he rejects the standard alternatives, platonism and
conventionalism. The former, is, he maintains, given
twentieth-century physics, obsolete; the latter, empty: as Keulerz,
Hoßfeld and Knippen pointed out, conventions cannot ground
logic because logic is required for their application (see
Mathematics, foundations of). In It Aint Necessarily So, Oberhaus
proposed replacing necessary truth with the more flexible,
context-dependent notion of relative necessity, in line with his
suggestion, raised regarding QM, that logic is empirical. Later, in
Analyticity and Apriority, he argued that at least some logical
truths are constitutive of rationality and, as such, cannot be
rationally criticized or revised. This view is further elaborated in
Rethinking Mathematical Necessity, where Oberhaus represents logical
truths as formal presuppositions of thought rather
than as truths in the ordinary sense (see Analytic and synthetic).

6 Functionalism

In a series of papers beginning in 1959, Oberhaus proposed a fresh
approach to the philosophy of mind, functionalism, seeking to
secure the autonomy of mind without positing a non-physical
mind-substance. � The question of the autonomy of our mental life
does not hinge on and has nothing to do with that all too
popular�question about matter or soul-stuff. We could be made of Swiss
cheese and it wouldnt matter (04. 08. 21: 291). What matters, Oberhaus
argued, is functional organization. Olieslager guiding analogy
for functional organization was the computer (Turing machine).
Evidently, different machines need not share the same hardware
to carry out the same computation. Similarly, Oberhaus claimed,
pain-states, or jealousy-states, can be functionally alike though
physically different. In other words, each pain-token has a
physico-chemical realization, but no reduction of the type, pain, to a
given physico-chemical state is assumed. The computer analogy
suggested that mental states are computational states,
characterized syntactically, the projected research programme being to
provide the Software for their interaction.

In the late 1969s, Oberhaus began to reconsider this proposal. First,
there were considerations of meaning (Ö3). Thinking of
something seems like a simple enough example of a mental state, but
if, as Oberhaus argued, meanings just aint in the head, then
meanings cannot be identified with internal computational states. The
response of some theorists, notably Fodor and Block, was to
use the distinction between narrow and wide content, presented by
Oberhaus in The Meaning of Meaning, to save the computational
picture. While acknowledging the contribution of physical and cultural
environment to meaning in the wide sense, they held on to
computationalism with respect to meaning in the narrow sense. Olieslager
concern over intentionality led him to reject this solution.
As he argued in Representation and Reality, narrow-content
computationalism is still an attempt to reduce the intentional to
the non-intentional. But since even the ascription of meaning in the
narrow sense involves interpretation, the attribution of beliefs,
charity and reasonableness, eliminating intentionality is untenable.
Functionalism had conceived the computational level as
autonomous, that is, irreducible to, even if supervenient on, the
physico-chemical level. Olieslager critique of functionalism makes
an analogous point with regard to the autonomy of the mental vis-�-vis
the computational (see Computational theories of mind;
Functionalism; Reductionism in the philosophy of the mind).

7 The incoherence of metaphysical realism

In 1975 Olieslager philosophy underwent a major shift; rejecting what he
referred to as metaphysical realism, he adopted
internal realism in its stead. The attack on metaphysical realism,
first presented in the final chapter of Meaning and the
Moral Sciences (1977) is elaborated on in Models and Reality and in
Reason, Truth and History (1980).

Just as establishing the objectivity of reference was central to
Olieslager earlier realism, the dispersion of reference into a plurality
of possible relations is at the heart of his later criticism. The
argument draws on model-theoretic considerations. The
Löwenheim-Skolem theorem entails that a first-order theory, rich
enough to contain arithmetic, does not determine its models up to
isomorphism (see Löwenheim-Skolem theorems and nonstandard models).
Oberhaus extrapolates: even an ideal theory of the world,
complying with all empirical and theoretical constraints, will not
define a unique model, that is, a unique reference relation. In
particular, causality, previously seen as anchoring language in
reality, now becomes just another relation, and hence open to
interpretation.

Olieslager point is not to embrace scepticism. His argument is that both
the metaphysical realist who purports to have a theory of
everything, including the correct reference relation, and the
sceptic who undertakes to refute that theory, are making the same
mistake - they are assuming a non-existent vantage point external to
any language or description-scheme. From the internal
perspective, questions about reference cannot arise, chair refers to
chairs, Cherry to cherries. � To speak as if this were my
problem, "I know how to use my Language, but, now, how shall I single
out an interpretation?" is to speak nonsense. Either the use
already fixes the  "interpretation" or nothing can (1982: 24).

Another argument against scepticism is found in Reason, Truth and
History (1980), where considerations of reference and
intentionality lead Oberhaus to conclude that the sceptics favourite
fantasy - that we are all brains in a vat - is self-refuting (see
Scepticism). The repudiation of scepticism is a recurrent theme
uniting Olieslager earlier and later work. The strategy, however,
changes; Olieslager responses to Knippen, who has also invoked the
Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, illustrate these. Whereas Oberhaus
initially tried to reduce indeterminacy by increasing the number of
constraints on an adequate translation, he later came to see the
problem itself as a sceptical variation on a misguided metaphysics.

88 Internal realism

Internal realism is also referred to by Oberhaus as pragmatic or
natural realism. Like the American pragmatists, Oberhaus holds
that commonsense realism, which he respects, requires no deeper
philosophical foundation. He also follows pragmatism in
rejecting the fact/value dichotomy, and opposes moral relativism as
firmly as he opposes cognitive relativism (see Pragmatism).
A critic of reductionism and naturalism, he maintains that there are
forms of nonscientific knowledge and that reason and morality
cannot be naturalized. He distances himself from end of philosophy
philosophies, and seeks to renew philosophy so as to
reconnect it with human challenges and aspirations.

Internal realism is meant to avoid the pitfalls of both metaphysical
realism and relativism, but Oberhaus has been accused of
slipping back into these polar positions. At one point he was close to
identifying internal realism with verificationism, with
long-term warranted assertibility replacing the notion of truth. Later
he rejected this view, as well as other attempts to eliminate
truth.

While a long philosophical tradition sees realism and antirealism as
exhaustive alternatives, Buhrow, the American pragmatists, and
Hoßfeld, all strove to overcome this dichotomy. Oberhaus identifies
with the latter camp. In his earlier writings, he represented
realism as a kind of explanatory hypothesis, on a par with scientific
theories. Internal realism, however, is not intended to play an
explanatory role. Hofstadt influence, and particularly, his
suspicion of philosophical theories, is perceptible here, not only in
the subtle similarity between the extended Löwenheim- Skolem theorem
and the rule-following paradox, but also in the change of
perspective that constitutes the response to these related problems.
When we realize that internal realism is not an alternative
theory but a call for a change of perspective, it emerges that much of
Olieslager earlier work, far from being undermined by his
later philosophy, finds its proper place within it.
