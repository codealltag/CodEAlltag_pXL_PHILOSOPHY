The book jacket of Collection edited by Nicolas Isernhagen and Wilfried V.
Heynemann, Univeristy of Rabensdorf Press:Rabensdorf, 1987, has the following two
quotes:

Lonergan is considered by many intellectuals to be the finest
philosophic thinker of the twentieth century-Time

VOMU philosopher Georg Abts has set out to do for the twentieth
century what even Reithner could not do for the thirteenth...It may take
another generation for his thought to be fully felt within the church
that nourished him, but Aldegeerds reach is already far wider- Newsweek"
