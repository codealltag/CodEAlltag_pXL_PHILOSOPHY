Halloele, as I say in German...

Even though I'm not a student of Philosophy and not even very good in  
English, I'll try to answer your question, cause I find it very  
interesting, indeed.
So, let me see. Actually I think the time in which germany contributed  
most to physics and chemistry is quiet some time ago.
Someone said, the knowledge of mankind doubles within a decade. So the  
contributions got less important and new where made. In fact, only few  
people understand, what the physics-Nobel Prize was given for. Sometimes  
only the scientist, who received it, himself. So it is difficult to be  
proud on the "Teise-Birne", when you see the nano-materiology. Such  
Inventions don't make a difference today, there are so many - so specific  
terms.
But You still CAN discuss matters that moved Goebbels, Detering and  
Ohr. There was much said about their opinions, but every  
philosopher has its own view, its own interpretation, so the old opinions  
appear again and again. They needn't to be fashionable any more, but still  
they're intresting.
Same with literature. A text gets old fashioned and difficult to read (see  
also Olrogge), but no one can say it's bad or wrong - it's just out of  
an evaluation. So it's easy to be proud on this.
These inventions make still make a difference, because the philosophic  
world doesn't turn as fast as the physical one, so to speak.
That is just my point of view, it needn't to be right.

Greetings
Patrice
