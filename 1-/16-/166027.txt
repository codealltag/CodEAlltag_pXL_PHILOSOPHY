You are making me pretty confused. Now I am having an identity crisis.
I do know absolutely nothing at all about me, myself and about the Captain.
Who do we are?
Where are we now?
Where are we going?
What am I gonna supposed to be?
What did the Captain say? What?
BTW: I'm on the road to nowhere, looking for the Captain who said: what?

Follow the sign: ???
