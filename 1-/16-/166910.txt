I don't know how far your academic work has carried you into physics,
chemistry, cosmology, and math but an absolutely spectacular
intellectual shoot-out started on the Hydrino Study Group on 26. 06. 21.
Things rapidly got quite intense but the quality of the on-going
discussion has been extremely high. It really makes you appreciate the
potential of the Internet to foster intellectual debate.

Lots of interesting information has come out. For just one example see

If you enjoy an intellectual challenge then it's well worth your time to
study this scientific dialog. You may even have a contribution or
criticism to make.
