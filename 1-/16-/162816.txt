: I have noticed that Germans seem to be far more proud of their philosophy
: and literary history than they are of their scientific heritage.  

They don't understand neither usually. This is a cyncical generalization
and should not be used to harass or discriminate against individual
Germans in any way. I'm sure the situation in the United States is even
worse.

: Germany is often referred to as the land of philosophers and poets.
: Considering Germany's amazing contributions to physics, mathematics, and
: chemistry, I find this bewildering.  Could anyone share some insight into
: this?  

This is an issue of "tradition". Germany has a tradition to hold 
fields which emphasize "formal literacy" (knowing your sources; knowing
who said when what; argument by authority; etc.) in high esteem. This
dates back to the Christian Scholastiker and their schools even. 
Scientific/technical fields of study -- which employ sharp thinking, analysis,
searching for truth and applications -- are regarded as de'classe'. In fact,
"theology" is taught as a science at German universities! The case has also
a social background. "Gelehrte", "Gebildete", "Studierte" have an
exceptional social status (if they have the formal qualifications --
no matter what bullshit they generate --, which take about half a life to
earn), compared to, let's say, the man who's repairing your bathroom. So 
"loving" parents urge their children -- who maybe would have become
happy bathroom experts -- to "study". Yes, that's it: the discipline
is unimportant. Of course those people clog our universities and our
society, but fortunately they hold blah-blah-disciplines in high esteem
so physics and mathematics are quite unaffected (except that in 
public opinion they're quite near to a bathroom specialist).
