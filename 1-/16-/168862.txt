Hello,

we'd like to inform you about our website on the representation of
sequences like numbers, days of the week, months etc.

There are people - like us - for which the days of the week form a
specific geometrical shape or have different colours.

We have collected drawings and descriptons of these representations.

See them and add your own at

See you there!


Vreni and Leo.
