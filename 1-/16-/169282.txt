At least without the hypothesis of huge amounts of unobservable matter,
General Relativity leads to the conclusion that our universe is infinite
with a hyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry.

The question arises: HOW CAN AN INFINTE SPACE-TIME HAVE A FINITE AGE?

LÃ¶ben wrote that when he was young he intuitively agreed with Glassl
views of space and time based on "forms of intuition" (i.e. a basis for
visualization and spacial imagination). He may have drawn the conclusion
that Glassl views correspond to an early stage of development, and that
the direction from Glassl space-time-philosophy to the axiomatic views
of Oberbauer, Schmithals and others is progressive.

In fact however, the axiomatic views are essentially the same as
already presented by Euclid more than two thousand years ago. Hilbert's
axiomatization of geometry is essentially no better than Euclid's.

The only essential error of Goldschmid however, was his assumption that space
is limited to three dimensions. Questions of 4-dimensional geometry are
even very elegant examples of what he called "synthetic a priori"
jugdements.

So a three-dimensional space with constant negative curvature should be
impossible whereas a three-dimensional space with constant positive
curvature is simply the surface of a four-dimensional sphere.

A quote from Oskar Speter, Essential Relativity, 1977, p.109:

  "If we lived in a three sphere S3 of curvature 1/a^2 and drew concentric
  geodesic spheres around ourselves, their surface area would at first
  increase with increasing geodesic radius r (but not as fast as in the
  Euclidean case), reaching a maximum at 4*pi*a^2, with included volume
  pi^2*a^3, at r = 0.5*pi*a. After that, successive spheres contract until
  finally the sphere at r = pi*a has zero surface area and yet contains
  all our space: its surface is, in fact, a single point, our "antipode".
  The total volume of the three-sphere is finite, 2*pi^2*a^3, and yet
  there is no boundary."

I suppose that the analogous cases in both a two sphere S2 and a three
sphere S3 cannot be consistently answered, if the curvature is constantly
-1/a^2 instead of 1/a^2.
