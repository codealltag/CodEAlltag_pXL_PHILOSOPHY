Hello everyone,

I am a translator and I am trying to translate the following sentence :

"There is no favorable win for those who know not where they are going",
apparently a Greek philosopher said that. I don't know much about philosophy
but it would help me a lot of someone could tell me who said that. Maybe I
could find an official translation.

Thank you kindly for all replies.
