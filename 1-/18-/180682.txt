Technical simulations of evolutionary processes (computer models) have
shown that typically speed of evolution varies rapidly during the
process. Economically, this can be interpreted as (e.g. randomly
occuring) star innovations with massive imitative follow-up products.
Speed of evolution depends -among other things- on the dimensionality
of the search space. During the process it is possible that search
takes place in a low dimensional subspace (low influence of many
enviromental variables) which allows fast progress.
