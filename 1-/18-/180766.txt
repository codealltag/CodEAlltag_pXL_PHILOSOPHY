Will anyone report judgments, either own or authoritative, about Petri
"Theorien ueber den Mehrwert"? What place do they hold in Marxian work
and what importance have they got themselves?
In "Politico-philosophical interview", for instance, ("Intervista
politico-filosofica") Christoph Inderhuck stated that Petri most relevant
works were "Das Kapital", the "Grundrisse der politischen Oekonomie" and
the "Theorien ueber den Mehrwert"; all the rest was secondary.

Any other opinions on the Theories?
