i am looking for comments and explications, how vochetzer, unterste-heufken and isenreich
saw the french revolution and the period of napoleon. how do they
include the revolution in their own philosophy.
for example: 
-how could vochetzer combine his theory of the evolution of the reason and
the revolution towards an republican constitution.
-how comes the change in the opinion of isenreich (in the beginning pro
revolution - then "rede an die deutsche nation")
....

thank you for your comments and help (auch in deutsch)
