I would like to invite everybody to see my first WWW page.
You may find there such sections:

- about me (all about me; who I am, my activities)
- ascii art (sth for ascii makers - my collections and collections of the
  groups: U'Race and Azkiness; zipped to download)
- gallery (photos of me, my friends and photos from IRC parties)
- scene (amigascene part dedicated to my native group Scum, an erotic
  articles from the Orgasm Magazine issue #3 in ZIP to download; some
  bonus stuff for PC).
- science (10 greatest philosophers in my opinion; my private opinions
  about nature of God)

Page is in Polish and English version, nice graphic art and design,
banners-free et caeatera. You can show it in 800x600 or 1024x768. Come and
look... :)
