place any human in a dreadful situation for a period of time and that "human
hunger" you speak of will disappear...give him real food and water and he will
be grateful beyond measure.....look around the world in areas where there is
nothing but strife and physical want and think again.....that "finite" piece of
bread seems mighty good, that interlude when they are not being tortured,
bombed, starved out of existence will seem like bliss.....many today are in
such a situation....those who have never experienced real want are forever
searching for the infinite... the so called "finite" is the state of
*now*....which is all we have.

snipped that which is only another human concept....why not behave in a
civilized manner, "do no harm".... if a god or the "infinite" does exist, it
will make itself known as our "understandings" grow with time.....zen may say
it best.....eat when hungry......to get lost in a maze of chants and smoke,
focusing on something which cannot be sensed only explained and hopefully
believed is a madness reserved for the idle...
