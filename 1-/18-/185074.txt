"Listen boy, trust noone", I heard the old man say.
His face was full of sorrow, full of wrinkles anyway.
He started then to tell me how his life has passed him by,
And after he had finished this, he gave a silent sight.
His disappointment covered him - a dark and heavy cloud.
Frustration grew inside his mind - and hate and fear and doubt.
I wanted to comfort the man and smiling took his hand.
"Trust ev'ryone - and then", I said, "one day they'll understand."
