As energy can have more or less value (less or more
entropy), "Mehrwert" - as used in economics - lets me
look at my field, which is not in economics. (I have
to deal with entropy in data compression and data
transmission).

"Using" energy (or any resource) means increasing its
entropy. "Using" capital probably means the same. Could
it be, that societies demand VATs for being used as a
drain for entropy?

It may be interesting for economists to have a closer
look at the 2nd "law" of thermodynamics when dealing
with the concept of "Mehrwert".
