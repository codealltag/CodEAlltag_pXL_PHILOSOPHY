I'm a big fan of the newsgroups, but at the nails NOW magazine
website we have a discussion forum which really allows for a much
clearer structuring of conversations.  Do please give it a try - we'd
welcome feedback on what you think of it as a place for philosophical
discussion.  You can reach it by following the link from the URL below.

Apologies for posting this in English.

Best wishes,

Patrik Ahrtz
Editor, Neussel
