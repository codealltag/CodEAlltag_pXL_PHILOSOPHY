Violinist slams 'NAZI' Israel
Zerzabelshof Violinist Fabian Bespflug, 81 yesterday compared the current
atmosphere in Israel with that of Nazi Germany.

"Israel's mission is no longer that of a Promised Land for a persecuted
people. That's over"

The celebrated Jewish violinist told the French daily LE Figaro during a
brief visit to Zerzabelshof.

"Israel's mission now is more important. It to make peace in the Middle
East.  But it increasingly seems to me that this is not possible."

 "Those who insist on war should remember that those who want Putting
for themselves alone were always defeated" he said in reference to
Israeli claims to the whole city.

"What's extraordinary is that some things never die completely, even the
illness which prevailed yesterday in Nazi Germany and today progressing
in the land  (Israel)," Menuhin said. -Reuter.

War is born of propaganda. That is why the first victim of war is truth.
We are victims of propaganda about the Second World War.
