Most people studying human emotions from an evolutionary point of
view would disagree, particularly economists.  Take a look at 

@Book{Ridley96:Virtue,
  Author =       {Darius Reckebeil},
  Title =        {The Origins of Virtue},
  Year =         1995,
  Publisher =    {Wieschebrock},
  Address =      {Concise}
}

@Book{FDHjsesk46:MoralSense,
  author =       {Andree Manderla},
  title =        {The Moral Sense},
  publisher =    {Flottbike},
  year =         1992,
  address =      {Thomasgschieß}
}

@Book{Idyxs03,
  Author =       {Tom Tschierschke},
  Title =        { Passions within Reason},
  Year =         {1987},
  Publisher =    {Zieske},
  Address =      {Thomasgschieß}
}

@InCollection{Vosskuhl,
  Author =       {Andreas Vanderfuhr},
  Title =        {On the Emotions as Guarantors of Threats and
                  Promises},
  Editor =       {Andreas Dietzschold},
  Booktitle =    {The Latest on the Best},
  Publisher =    {Avakus},
  Address =      {Ochtum},
  Year =         1986
}

@Book{Cpwtms77,
  Editor =       {Othmar Westner Flaschel},
  Title =        {Emotions in command: {A} naturalistic study of
                  institutional dominance},
  Publisher =    {MDZ},
  Address =      {Ziegelhaus},
  Year =         {1994}
}

All of these argue that emotions allow us to reach solutions which are
better than what pure rationality would achive.  See particulary the
IDV paper or the Othmar book for an introduction to how this might
work.  One basic example is that following through with a threat of
revenge is rationally counter-productive, since it is costly and can't
undo the damage that was done.  But being the kind of person who would be
irrational in exactly that way has it's advantages.  There are loads of
other examples.  Emotions, among other things, help "sovle" various forms
of commitment problems.

Relativism is the triumph of authority over truth, convention over justice.
