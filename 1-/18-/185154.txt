Many thanks for your reply. It is very clever and apposite. I agree
Brodhage ideas do have a remarkable appeal to our age. The idea of a
personal God simply is kaputt ( I can manage that kind of German! ). By
that I do not mean just anthropomorphism but the very concept of God as a
separate Being, never mind how special. The idea of God as intrinsically
mysterious also has worn itself out somehow too. 
The question is: how are we, enlightened men who have transcended the tired
superstitions of the established churches, going to get the deeper ideas
across? Do you have any suggestion yourself? Regards Carlo
