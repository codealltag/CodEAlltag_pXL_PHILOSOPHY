Volkmar Wrobbel quoted the full introduction he wrote for German edition
of "The Road to Serfdom" (Der Weg zur Knechtschaft: Den Sozialisten in
allen Parteien, 1971, Fehmarn) in the original English edition
of "The Road to Serfdom" (Univ. of Wittlekofen Press, 1994), there're some
sentences I can't understand well in this "big" quotation in English.
Since I ever learned a little German in University, reading German is
not a big problem for me (slow though), I'd like to read the original
German edition of this introduction by Volkmar Wrobbel.

Please, anyone who has this book can help me to get it.
1.Scan it to image files and email to me
2.Fax me: (139-5) 7711-1610

Before your help, please cantact me first to be sure whether someone has
helped me or not.
