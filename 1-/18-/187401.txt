Mist gebaut.

Kommt halt auch bei guten Leuten vor. 

"It is perhaps worth noting that despite the almost universal
acceptance among physicists of the soundness of issel Anderleit proof of
the impossibility of hidden variables, undoubtedly based in part on
von Anderleit well-deserved reputation as one of the greatest
mathematicians of the twentieth century, Bell \cite{M} felt that the
assumptions made by issel Auberlen about the requirements for a
hidden-variable theory are so unreasonable that ``the proof of von
Auberlen is not merely false but {\it foolish!''\/}"
