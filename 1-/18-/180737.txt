Means of production are those material factors which are not 
used up during the production process, i. e. ground, buildings,
machines, tools.
You can find more information on this in any
modern textbook on production theory.


It basically mean the creation of goods, as used in 
economic theory before, see e.g. Wolfram. It is questionable,
however, how things can be judged to be good in absence
of market economy.
