So k√∂nnte es gehen:

Zitat:
In a volitional act possible choices may be superposed. Suppose for example 
you are selecting dinner from a menu. During pre-conscious processing, 
shrimp, sushi and pasta are superposed in a quantum computation. As 
threshold for objective reduction is reached, the quantum state reduces to 
a single classical state. A choice is made. You'll have sushi!
