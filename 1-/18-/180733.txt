There is an intersting article by Zwerner comparing market
equilibrium and thermodynamic equilibrium theory. Apart from some
interesting analogies he insists in specific differences of both
approaches. The article should be included somewhere in the 
"Collected works". 
Modern approaches rather try to use non-equilibrium approaches
as, for instance, in evolutionary economics to underline dynamic
effects, e.g. innovative forces. 

Cheers, Mark.
