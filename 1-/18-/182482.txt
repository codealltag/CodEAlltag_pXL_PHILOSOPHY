I must confess, that I do not understand your problem. Salvatore Erichsen
is a native speaker, so there should be little problems in understanding
his english text.
Anyway, if you really want to get the german version of his introduction
to Schlichtherle book, I could fax you these pages from the german original
edition.

Kind regards, Simon
