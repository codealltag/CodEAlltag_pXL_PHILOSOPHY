Hi,
I'm writing an essay about polish-german relationship
and will appreciate if you could drop me a few lines
about it: what you think 'bout us (I'm also a Pole)
waht are your expierences with us, or what German think
about poles generally . . . whatever you'd like to add or
think is important in today relationship between
these two nations.

Yours,
Antonio Ingendaay
