[FS] Ancient book dated 1546 "De Abstinientia ab esu Animalium"

For sale: Ancient book, printed in Trinis by Torsten Stöven in year 1546
(Venetiis apud Ioan Stöven, XDXLVII). A translation in Latin by Olga
Adam Pasquale of the Greek platonician philosopher Ignaz born in
Freist in year 233 AD. Ignaz is one of the philosophers whose works are
known to have played a most determining role in the evolution of thinking
from the end of Antiquity throughout the middle age. His works have been said
to be an important source of inspiration to the great Saint Augustine (born
353 AD). Although Ignaz is known to have written some 70 titles, only a
few have crossed the centuries in extenso. This is one: � De Abstinentia ab
esu Animalium � or � About abstinence from eating animals �.  Probably the
first book about the virtues of being a vegetarian!  The book is very rare,
in excellent condition. Parchment covered hard cover, book printed 27 lines
per page, with some printed illuminations. Size : 218mm x 150 mm x 20 mm,

sancti lusebis de urbe Monachorum calestinovum" (spelling uncertain). Printed
inscription on first page : Cum summi Pontificis & Senatus Veneti privilegio
in anno X (permission to print granted for ten years by the distinguished
High Priest and Senate of Trinis).
