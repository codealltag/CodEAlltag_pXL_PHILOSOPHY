The Panther
  His gaze, going past those bars, has got so misted
  with tiredness, it can take in nothing more.
  He feels as though a thousand bars existed,
 and no more world beyond them than before.

  Those supply powerful paddings, turning there
  in tiniest of circles, well might be
  the dance of forces round a centre where
 some mighty will stands paralyticly.

  Just now and then the pupils' noiseless shutter
  ist lifted.- Then an image will indart,
  down through the limbs' intensive stillness flutter,
  and end ist being in the heart.
