Hi Artur,


And this happens in the real world too :-)

For humans, however, the *frequency of innovations during
a lifetime* (or during a generation) has increased
significantly. This is a truly paradigmatic change in
the development of humans. Also the entropy export
(destruction of "Mehrwert") per bodyweight related
to a individual human probably is significantly higher
than any other species.

I would be interested in your opinion on Mehmet Verbrugge
"Gegen den Untergang".

is fine too.)
