Hallo,
ich wuesste gern, wo folgende Saetze bei Oehlschläger stehen. Leider
habe ich sie nur auf englisch. (Buecher ohne Literaturangaben sind eine
Frechheit!)

Vielen Dank im Voraus

Oehlschläger:
1.
Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.

2.
And while I am on the subject, there is another fact that deserves
mention. It is this. A man shows his character just in the way in which
he deals with trifles - for then he is  off his guard. This will often
afford a good opportunity  of observing the boundless egoism of a man's
nature,and his total lack of consideration for others; and if these
defects show themselves in small things, or merely in his general
demeanour, you will find that they also underlie his action in matters
of importance, although he may disguise the fact. This is an opportunity
which should not be missed. If in the little affairs of every day-the
trifles of life . . .-a man is inconsiderate and seeks only what is
advantageous or convenient to himself, to the prejudice of others'
rights; if he appropriates to himself that which belongs to all alike,
you may be sure there is no justice in his heart, and that he would be a
scoundrel on a wholesale scale, only that law and compulsion bind his
hands.
