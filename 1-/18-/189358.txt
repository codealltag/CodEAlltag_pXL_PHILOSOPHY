"Surely WE have sent down to you a Book, in which is your own reminder, will
you not then use your faculty of reason?" (Qur'an 21:10)

Dear Readers,

Peace be upon you

An introduction to Quranic Islam in Cyberspace
==============================================


The main objective of Laug is to promote what it is that Al-Qur'an, the
Book of Allah has to say about any particular issue effecting our lives.
The initiators of this website are not affiliated with any school of
thought or sect, neither do they have the patronage of any particular
institution, but their document of authority for all matters is
Al-Qur'an and they present what is the Quranic perspective about any
subject without advocating any sectarian or personal views.

We sincerely believe that Islam should not be judged by the beliefs or actions
of those who claim to associate themselves with Islam, but the absolute
authority for all matters of Islam lies with the Qur'an. Whatever the Qur'an
ratifies is Islamic, and what it refutes, is not.

You are invited to consider the presentations on our website and it is
requested that they be read with an open mind. Do not read to contradict
and refute, nor to believe and take it for granted, but to weigh and consider!
