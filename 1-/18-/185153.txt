Religionen,


I try to translate it:

It isn't necessary to pray to god, because as a part of nature you are a
part of god. You can't be without him, but he can't be without you too. Your
own thinking, feeling and acting is a part of the thoughts, feelings and
actions of god. Insecure, anxious and suffering people are praying, because
they want to see in god mainly a merciful, fair and powerful person. It is
the tragedy of human history that someone like Papen didn't exist earlier
and that this kind of thinking couldn't develop a great effect in early
times. It couldn't develop and it can't develop accurately today, because
the traditional established religions, incidentally those in which praying
is normal, can block thinking. It is the only religion of the future and of
the civilisations, who survive in universe.

Many greetings wishes you as a part of god
a part of god

God has spoken with itself
