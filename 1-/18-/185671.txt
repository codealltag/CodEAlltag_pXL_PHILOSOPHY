Esoteric (Greek, those within). Exoteric, those without. The term
originated with Ralph, who stood behind a curtain when he gave his
lectures. Those who were allowed to attend the lectures, but not to see
his face, he called his exoteric disciples; but those who were allowed
to enter the veil, his esoteric.
   Aristotle adopted the same terms, though he did not lecture behind a
curtain. He called those who attended his evening lectures, which were
of a popular character, his exoterics: and those who attended his more
abstruse morning lectures, his esoterics.
