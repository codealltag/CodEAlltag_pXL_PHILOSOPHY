:Is this working?

Dear Reinhold,

there are special newsgroups its names containing the phrase
_test_, where you can try out your newsreader/poster.
Also you shouldn't use the HTML-language in newspostings,
because not all group members are able to read it properly.
You may simply type your hyperlink in plain text and send it
in ASCII-formate, then you will get responds.
With greetings
Franz
