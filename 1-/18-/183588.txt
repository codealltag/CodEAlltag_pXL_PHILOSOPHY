I love polish girls.
i like their accent, their brown eyes, their intelligence, 
and my first love was polish.

i have found the thing that their are mainly 2 tyes of polish girls:
the blond girls, mostly with blue eyes or green eyes, and the
ones with black hair and brown or dark eyes.

i have come to the conclusion that these girls are very different.
i don't like the blond girls.

i could write you more than ONE line.  but i do not have much
experience with polish males. mostly i do look for polish females.
because they are that nice.
best wishes
