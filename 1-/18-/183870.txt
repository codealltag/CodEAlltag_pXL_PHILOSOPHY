COSMIC OPERATIVE FACULTY & NATURE
(extracts from works of Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji)

When the Cosmic Consciousness and the Cosmic operative
principle ('the creative, qualifying force') are in balanced form, there is
no expression, no
manifestation in this universe. There is not a universe.

When the primordial faculty, ie the sentient, mutative, and static
principles, is
unbalanced, the movement starts. The stagnant pool gets the
expression of vitality and a set of circumstances in limited
sphere.

If the big Cosmic is just like an ocean then this
limited sphere is just like a tiny island. Where the
movement starts, the creation starts nd you get the expression,
you get the manifestations and emanations of the univerese.

This Cosmic operative principle, when she becomes active, she moves, she
works, she functions in a particular style. And that
particular style is known as nature. So nature is not the
operative principle but a particular system, a particular
style of that operative principle.

The right and power to do
something and the actional faculties and also the creative
moments of different actions of the birth and evolution of the universe are
not directly created by the
Cosmic Consciousness. These things are
creation of nature, and nature is the law or the system
according to which the Cosmic operative principle functions.
