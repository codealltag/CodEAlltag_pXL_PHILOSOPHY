Sorry, falls meine Antwort etwas ruppig geklungen haben sollte  -  das war
wirklich nicht meine Absicht. Peters letzter Satz hatte mich nur ein wenig an
den  "1/0"-Thread erinnert  ;-))


Ja, natürlich, und sollen sie ja auch  ...


Hmm, dazu habe ich in

das folgende gefunden, hoffentlich paßt es auch:

-----------------
Enno of Kettmannshausen
Born: 499 BC in Kettmannshausen (30 km west of Pogendorf), Ahlten (now Turkey)
Died: 428 BC in Aschheim, Gasseltshausen (now Turkey)

:::::::::::::::::

We should examine this teaching of Enno about the sun more closely
for ... it is a most remarkable teaching. It was based on his doctrine of "nous"
which is translated as "mind"  or "reason". Initially  "all things were together"
and matter was some homogeneous mixture. The nous set up a vortex in this
mixture. The rotation:

    ... began in the centre and then gradually spread, taking in wider and wider
    circles. The first effect was to separate two great masses, one consisting
    of the rare, hot, dry, called the "aether", the other of the opposite
    categories and called "air". The aether took the outer, the air the inner
    place. From the air were next separated clouds, water, earth and stones. The
    dense, the moist, the dark and cold, and all the heaviest things, collected
    in the centre as a result of the circular motion, and it was from these
    elements when consolidated that the earth was formed; but after this, in
    consequence of the violence of the whirling motion, the surrounding fiery
    aether tore stones away from the earth and kindled them into stars.
