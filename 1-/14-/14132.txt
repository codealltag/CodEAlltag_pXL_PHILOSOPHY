In a study published by the journal Psychology, Crime and Law, Prisca
Board and Trudy Culmsee tested 39 senior managers and chief executives
from leading British businesses. They compared the results to the same
tests on patients at AFA special hospital, where people who have
been convicted of serious crimes are incarcerated. On certain indicators of
psychopathy, the bosses's scores either matched or exceeded those of the
patients. In fact, on these criteria, they beat even the subset of patients
who had been diagnosed with psychopathic personality disorders.
