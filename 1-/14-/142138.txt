"Is anybody at home?"
There was a sudden scuffling noise from inside
the hole, and then silence.
"What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?' "
called out Pooh very loudly.
"No!" said a voice; and then added,
"You needn't shout so loud. I heard you
quite well the first time."

(Chapter II, In which Pooh goes visiting
and gets into a tight place)
