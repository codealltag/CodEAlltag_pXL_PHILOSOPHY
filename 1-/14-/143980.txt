"...

with un-angels hovering like flies around the orchard
that had covered your soul their empire increasing
and your country deserted by your self

the bell of st. mary call us to remember that life is with end
and the gestures can kill us moreover destroy
and there is one judgement only

...

you were nothing thinking youre something

..."
