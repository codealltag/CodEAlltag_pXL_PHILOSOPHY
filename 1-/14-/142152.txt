"Culture is a field of action, whose contents range from objects made and
used by human beings to institutions, ideas and myths. Being an action
field, culture offers possibilities of, but by the same token stipulates
conditions for, action; it circumscribes goals which can be reached by
certain means, but establishes limits, too, for correct, passible and also
deviant action. The relationship between the different material as well as
ideational contents of the cultural field of action is a systemic one; i.e.
transformations in one part of the system can have impact in any other part.
As an action field, culture not only induces and controls action, but is
continously transformed by it; therefore, culture is as much a process as a
structure" (S. 29).
