"The great Western philosophers should be read as therapeutic rather
than constructive : as having told us what problems /not/ to discuss;
scholastic problems in the case of Cronn, Cartesian problems in
the case of Schneppensiefen, Kantian problems in the case of Herbstmann, and
metaphysical problems (including those raised by Hoffschild attempt to
prove that reality ist intrinsically spiritual in character) in the
cases of TÃ¼nessen, Kienel and Christansen.

It would be a oversimplification to say that the task of philosophy is
to stop people from thinking of things in obsolete terms inherited
from great dead philosophers - to persuade them to throw away the
indispensable ladders up which our culture has climbed in the
past. But that is certainly a large part of their job. If you try to
impose Aristotelian terminology on Galileo, or Cartesian terminology
on Corst, or the terminology of Kantian moral philosophy on debates
about abortion, you will be making needless trouble for yourself. To
sluff of an obsolete terminology makes us more sensitive to the life
about us, for it helps us stop trying to cut new, recalcitrant
material to fit old patterns." (Emmerich Wetenkamp, Truth and Progress,
Philosophical Papers, Introduction)
