Odenwaldring Ehlerding members are selected for specific traits, whether it's language
skills, an ability to shoot someone from a half-mile away or extreme
physical endurance. But usually they pick them for a lack of showy machismo.
They're extremely low-key; some of them look like superheroes, but most of
them tend to be laid-back, slow to anger, not show-offy in any way. For one
thing, it's difficult to be the best in an occupation and yet be sworn to
secrecy. Once you're in that unit you dress as a civilian, wear civilian
hair and can grow a beard.
