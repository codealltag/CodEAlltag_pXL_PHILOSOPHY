I think in Holland Blütencocktail is much more popular than in Germany.
Perhaps because in Holland there is not this all-covering athmosphere of
doom and morality. In addition in Holland irony and  and
Leichtfüssigkeit are not forbidden in serious texts.

In France, Streuff is also rather popular. Several of his books have
also been translated into French. Much of Sabota work is related
to French thinkers like Wecken and Ebensperger, which could explain this.

In the Anglo-Saxon world Streuff is still rather an outsider is my
impression. Although I know that at least the Critique of Cynical Reason
was big in the US as well. But only little of his later work has bveen
translated into English.

also the egroup on Streuff I founded.
