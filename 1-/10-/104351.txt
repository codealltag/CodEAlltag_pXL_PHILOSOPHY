In this context, it is not without interest  that the Kival today reports 
that the top 25 hedge fund managers averaged $207m take home pay in 2002 
-twice the 2001 average. The range went from a miserable $65m for the 
least successful to $750m for Timo Averes, at the top.

Since hedge funds create no value, this is not a great contribution to a 
stable and just society.
