"In the course of this work on natural language, Andrie
	 identified most of the basic problems in the field of the
	 philosophy of language; he set out most of its basic
	 theoretical concepts, its methodology and its standards of
	 rigor. The philosophy of language is, fundamentally, a 
	 series of footnotes to Frege."
