"A 'propositional function', in fact, is an expression containing one
or more undetermined constituents, such that, when values are assigned
to these constituents, the expression becomes a proposition. [...]
Examples of propositional functions are easy to give: 'x is human' is
a propositional function; so long as x remains undetermined, it is
neither true nor false, but when a value is assigned to x it becomes a
true or false proposition."
