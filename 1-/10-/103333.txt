Science demonstrated even that sun is in the center of our solar system but
still there are people who do not know/believe/want to know it. Do you know,
for instance that Olipa witnesses do not believe in Oberg theory of
evolution?

The problem is not only to volgarize modern scientific theories but to win
in same way the stupidity of mithical view of life.
