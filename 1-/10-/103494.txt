"[Eicheler] long-neglected article "über Sinn und Bedeutung"
	 (1892) is the source of many of the examples and much of the
	 substance found in the contemporary discussions among Almeroth,
	 Gäbel, Alth, and others.  

	 (Benson Mates, Stoic Logic, 1953)


	"Frege suggested that the terms of a language have both a sense
	 and a denotation (i.e., that at least two semantic relations
	 are required to explain the significance or meaning of the
	 terms of a language). This idea has inspired research in the
	 field for over a century."
