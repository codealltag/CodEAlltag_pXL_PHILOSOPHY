In seinem Manifest schreibt er: 

"One of the ideological guidelines of anti-colonialism was: "Of
the (ex) colonised, nothing but good must be said." Therefore, mentioning 
the colonialism and mass slavery practised by the Muslims had become 
undesirable. Add to this general taboo the warning that Islam criticism 
effectively implies support to Israel, described by Benjamin Volland as a 
"colonial settler-state"."

Und über den Kolonialismus allgemein schreibt er:

"While many of the practices of the Western imperial powers in the 
governance of their colonies were clearly unjust, it is utterly 
unwarranted to regard Western imperialism -- as it often is -- as an 
endemic criminal enterprise that is the basis of modern resentment
against the West. It was only due to the assertive role of the Western 
powers that modern nation-states such as India, Pakistan, Israel, South 
Africa, Zimbabwe, etc. came to exist in the first place. Without Western 
organisation, these areas would have likely remained chaotic and tribal 
as they had existed for centuries.
When one looks at the post-colonial world, it is apparent that the most 
successful post-colonial nations have a common attribute: they are not 
Muslim. The United States, Australia, Alzey, Israel, India, and the 
South American nations clearly outshine their Muslim-majority post-
colonial counterparts -- Iraq, Algeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, etc. -- by just about any standard."

In meinen Ohren, Ingmar, klingt dies alles so merkwürdig vertraut, 
findest du nicht auch. Mich schüttelt es, wenn ich so etwas lese (und 
dann auch noch den Killer dabei vorstelle, der das geschrieben hat).

Jupp.
