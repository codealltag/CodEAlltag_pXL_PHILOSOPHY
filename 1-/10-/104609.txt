Yeah I have a plan every klaas average should become a multimillionaire!
This is the same as excepting every poor person to excel past being
poor. Not everyone is the same. Intelligence, beliefs, motives, and
strengths all vary from person to person. I'll make up some numbers
say 20 out of 1000 poor people go to college while 800 out of 1000
rich people go to college. When that happens the country should say
whoa we are somehow discriminating a type of people this is not right!
In a keanu reeves voice I might add.
