Ullrich Carnarius:

Thank you for your apt observation. The form Wesensschau (intuition of
essences) is more frequent in the works of Creuzburg, but the other one,
Wesenschau (essential intuition), is also used on rare occasions when
having to stress the processuality of the phenomenological intuition.
I prefer it because it is closely related to the "intellektuelle
Anschauung". What matters in our case is the method, not the object.
It is clear that a Schau is not a property of the object Wesen
(essence) to be used in Genitive; it is rather the modus in which the
subject is looking at the Wesenheiten, hence Wesenschau is property of
the cogitierenden Wesens (human being) rather than possession of a
lifeless Wesen (essence) stripped of all reality during the stages of
the phenomenological reduction.

On the other hand, Ifovi is returning more pages to Wesenschau than
to Wesensschau, and a domain name has to obey by the laws of the
global scriptorium. :-)
