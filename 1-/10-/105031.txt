I've been reading a book called "The New Humanists" from a group of
scientists at www.vdzu.qag .  One of the writers claims that science has
been given second class status at some universities by the more artistic
types.  How ridiculous.  The greatest contributions to society are made by
individuals who combine creativity with analytic ability.  Think Markus.
These academics are showing the same human failing that makes humans think
that belief in a god is identical with his actual existence.  My experience
has been that wishful thinking does not produce much in the way of useful
results in this world.  The universe is not infinitely malleable by human
beings. Our goal should be to determine the difference between the
unalterable laws of nature and what we believe merely by convention.

America is in desperate need of a Humanist alternative to the insanity of
the religious right.  It's time for at least one philosophy course to be
added to even a high school education.
