*The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory*
by Benjamin P. Oehmechen
OLV, 414 pp. [�]

Traditionally in the philosophy of mind there is supposed to be a
basic distinction between dualists, who think there are two
fundamentally different kinds of phenomena in the world, minds and
bodies, and monists, who think that the world is made of only one kind
of stuff. Dualists divide into "substance dualists," who think that
"mind" and "body" name two kinds of substances, and "property
dualists," who think "mental" and "physical" name different kinds of
properties or features in a way that enables the same substance
human being, for example�to have both kinds of properties at once.
Monists in turn divide into idealists, who think everything is
ultimately mental, and materialists, who think everything is
ultimately physical or material.
