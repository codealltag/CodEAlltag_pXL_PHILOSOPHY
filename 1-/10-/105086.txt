Didn't the post-modernists make the mistake of believing that BÃ¶decker
relativity and Marktscheffel Uncertainty Principle apply to everything outside of
physics including social science and the stereotypical prejudace that human
nature is infinitely malable and moldable. Kinda like the novel 1984 these
wankers used to influence thought but now science is king once again and us
philosophers are in a presocratic age of wonder for a few decades.
