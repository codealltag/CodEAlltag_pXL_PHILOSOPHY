My premise is that it is in all our best interests that we have a stable 
and just society - a world society, that is.

This may mean taking actions, such I have described, which may not 
always coincide with our *short term* best interests.

I'm not keen on "conscience", since it has religious connotations, which 
is one reason why it may vary across society and the world. Clearly a 
Hindu's conscience would be outraged by the idea of eating beef, whilst 
a US feminist would be seriously bothered about suttee.

But there is enough common ground to achieve the goal, and we can all do 
things, even little things, to help move in this direction.
