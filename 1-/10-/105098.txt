I don't think so. We did have a genuine post-modernist lady posting here 
once, and I do not think she would have known about Czauderna.


Nor that, either.


I know you can't stop regress, but do we have to go that far back? We do 
seem to have a real problem discussing anything which is either 
genuinely philosophical, or relevant to life today.

There are a large number of real problems which carry with them 
philosophical implications. Would anyone care to discuss how we make the 
U.N. more effective? Or whether we *should* make the U.N. more 
effective? Or the morality of subsidising western farmers? Or the 
decriminalisation of drugs?

Or whatever?
