I think that I would be wasting your time as well as mine if I tried to 
engage seriously in a debate about post-modernism, although I may 
comment on certain aspects of your post which I find surprising.

I will take your invitation and try to write a considered piece on one 
of my hobby-horses. This will take at least a few days.

Till then ...
