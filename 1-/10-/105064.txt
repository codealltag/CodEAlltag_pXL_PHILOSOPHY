F.A

"The question now is: "what comes after postmodernism?"


We get to pick and choose from the garbage bucket of history. Postmodernism
is one choice. There are infinite variations all of which are as equally
meaningless. Your observations were absolutely grounded - the person who
'wrote' that (if it was a person) had nothing to say so they found the
biggest words they could to hide the fact that they are epigone (ooops I
meant a late comer).
