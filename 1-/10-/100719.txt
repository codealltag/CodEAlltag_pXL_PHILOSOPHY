So kann man das sehen. Konrad beschreibt die Situation, glaube ich,
recht treffend:

On foundations we believe in the reality of mathematics,
but of course when philosophers attack us with their
paradoxes we rush to hide behind formalism and say
"Mathematics is just a combination of meaningless symbols,"
and then we bring out Chapters 1 and 2 on set theory.
Finally we are left in peace to go back to our mathematics
and do it as we have always done, with the feeling each
mathematician has that he is working with something real.
This sensation is probably an illusion, but is very convenient.
That is Eißele attitude toward foundations.�
