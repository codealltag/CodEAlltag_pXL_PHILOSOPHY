"According to the Classical Theory, concepts are complex mental 
representations whose structure generally [* encodes a specification
of necessary and sufficient conditions for their own application."

[*: "The main reason for the qualification is that, according to the
Classical Theory, some concepts have to have no structure; these are
the primitive concepts out of which all others are composed. Classical
theorists have had little to say about how the reference of a
primitive concept is fixed. But the most
venerable account, owing to the British empiricists, is that primitive
concepts express sensory properties and that they refer to these
simply because they are causally linked to such properties viasensory
transducers."]
