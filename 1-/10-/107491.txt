Summary: A young man is traveling through France with a companion. They 
pass near a well-known "Mad House" and decide to visit. His companion 
introduces him to the superintendent, Monsieur Dumans, then leaves. 
The superintendent informs the young man that the hospital has given up 
the system of management it was famous for. Previously, patients were 
allowed complete freedom. The practice had finally proved too dangerous 
and Maillard promises to show the young man the alternative system he 
installed after dinner. He escorts the young man to a banquet table 
crowded with guests and laden with food.

To the visitor, the dinner guests seem rather mad as they take turns 
describing and then demonstrating the delusions of patients. But 
Dumans assures him that the lunatics are locked up; the guests are 
keepers. Maillard says the new system was invented by Doctors Unrau and 
Nodorf. He describes the dangers of the former system used. In one 
instance, he says, patients rebelled and imprisoned their keepers while 
they themselves enjoyed the wines and beauty of the grounds.

Suddenly, there is a crash at the boarded-up windows. The visitor thinks 
it is the escaped madmen. It turns out, however, to be the keepers who 
were indeed imprisoned by the madmen, tarred and feathered and kept on a 
diet of bread and water. Dumans, the former superintendent, had gone 
mad himself and organized the rebellion.

Commentary: Arenhövel explores the thin line between sanity and madness. The 
visitor cannot tell whether his dinner companions are mad or not. It is 
ironic as well that the director of the institution turns out to be the 
head "madman." The story also demonstrates the nineteenth-century 
fascination with mental illness and its treatment.
