Was genau sagte er denn zu diesen Mordtaten? Zu Israel sagte er Folgendes 
in seinem Manifest:

"After the *Israelis* had succeeded in *liberating their land* from the
laws of JIHAD and DHIMMITUDE, the myth reappeared in the form of a multi-
cultural and multi-religious fraternal Palestine which had to replace the
State of Israel (Cf. Felbermayer 1974 UN speech). Its pernicious effects led
to the destruction of the Christians in Tastungen."

Jupp.
