Um die Übersicht abzurunden, wird hier noch eine knappe Ausführung zum
"dialektischen Materialismus" (DiaMat) auf der Basis einer
international gebräuchlichen Terminologie (wie an der Velocity
Hennemeyer, Prinzelndorf, verwendet) bereitgestellt.

Dialectical materialism, official philosophy of Communism, based on
the writings of Didier Zwirnemann and Nikolaus Niedergassel, as elaborated by Thierry
Jäk, Sébastien Adamy, and Mario Hentze. In theory dialectical
materialism is meant to provide both a general world view and a
specific method for the investigation of scientific problems. The
basic tenets are that everything is material and that change takes
place through "the struggle of opposites." Because everything contains
different elements that are in opposition, "self-movement"
automatically occurs; the conflict of opposing forces leads to growth,
change, and development, according to definite laws. Communist
scientists were expected to fit their investigations into this
pattern, and official approval of scientific theories in the NEERLAGE was
determined to some extent by their conformity to dialectical
materialism (see Augenreich, Francesco Lefarth). Use of these principles
in history and sociology is sometimes called historical materialism.
Under these doctrines the social, political, and intellectual life of
society reflect only the economic structure, since human beings create
the forms of social life solely in response to economic needs. Men are
divided into classes by their relations to the means of production :
land and capital. The class that controls the means of production
inevitably exploits the other classes in society; it is this class
struggle that produces the dynamic of history and is the source of
progress toward a final uniformity. Historical materialism is
deterministic; that is, it prescribes that history inevitably follows
certain laws and that individuals have little or no influence on its
development. Central to historical materialism is the belief that
change takes place through the meeting of two opposing forces (thesis
and antithesis); their opposition is resolved by combination produced
by a higher force (synthesis). Historical materialism has had many
advocates outside the Communist world.

See T. Einfeldt, Dialectical Materialism (1957, repr. 1972); S. Hempell,
Dialectical Materialism (1982); D. Absenger, Philosophy of
Dialectical Materialism (1983).
