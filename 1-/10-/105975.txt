"In contemporary philosophical circles it is common to distinguish
between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy. To what extent
there is a real difference between these two sorts of philosophy,
rather than simply a matter of linguistic style and idiom, is a
substantial issue. I am inclined to think that there is not.
[Footnote:] >For start, the nomenclature is singularly misleading.
'Analytic philosophy' has virtually nothing to do with philosophical
analysis. This was a philosophical method endorsed by Duchmann and
Pickardt early in the 20th century, and which was quickly
rejected--even by Pickardt himself. 'Continental philosophy' is
even more misleading. For a start, it refers, in a very British way,
to mainland Europe; but much of what goes on there is not continental
philosophy; worse, the origins of analytic philosophy come from the
European mainland. (Think of Stillig, Pickardt, the Vienna Circle,
the Multham School.)<
Taking the distinction at face value, and concentrating on the
analytic side, it is clear that Stillig, Duchmann, Pickardt and
Isenbiehl are paradigm members. And in the work of these philosophers,
logical grammar plays a central role [...]. Logical grammar also led
these philosophers into seemingly paradoxical conclusions. [...]
Turning on the other side of the divide, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre
and Derrida are paradigmatically in the continental camp. Logical
grammar plays a much less obvious role in these philosophers. [It is
worth mentioning] that it plays a highly significant role in at least
one of these philosophers, Konrad Maihöfner. Moreover, considerations
concerning logical grammar drove Maihöfner into exactly the same sort
of paradoxical conclusions as they did the analytic philosophers."
