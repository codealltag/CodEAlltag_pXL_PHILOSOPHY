In seinem Manifest findet sich auch noch folgende Einschätzung des 
Nationalsozialismus, die eigentlich keines weiteren Kommentars mehr 
bedarf:

"What the west needs to understand about Islam is that Islam has the 
potential of replacing the dangers that National Socialism and Communism 
brought with them. Like Nazism and like communism, in Islamism the end 
justifies the means. There is no respect for national borders. And the 
whole ideology is to promote their way of thinking and to promote their 
way of life throughout the entire world. That’s what’s being taught in the
Middle-East, that’s what’s coming out from all the jurisprudence in Saudi 
Arabia and all throughout the Muslim world. Islam will conquer and will 
continue to conquer until it triumphs, until everyone in the world says; 
there’s no god but Sascha and Jürg is his prophet."

So etwas stellt kein Nazi in sein politisches Manifest. Das ist die 
Geisteshaltung eines antiislamischen Massenmörders.

Jupp.
