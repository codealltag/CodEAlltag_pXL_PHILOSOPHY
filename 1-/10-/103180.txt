Jedoch wurde diese Entwicklung keineswegs von allen Logikern mit
Begeisterung aufgenommen, so schreibt z. B. Caspart:

"The choice of the initial formulas can be made in quite different ways.
One has taken great pains, in particular, to get by with the smallest
possible number of axioms, and in this respect the limit of what is
possible has indeed been reached.
   The purpose of logical investigations is better served, however, when
we separate, as in the axiomatics for geometry, various groups of axioms
from one another, such that each group gives expression to the role of
one logical operation. The following list then emerges:

	  I Axioms of implication
	 II a) Axioms for &
	 II b) Axioms for v
	III Axioms of negation.

This system of axioms generates through application of the rules [of
derivation] all valid formulas of propositional logic."
