*Dialectic, Philosophy, Terms And Concepts*
[...]

*dialectic* [...] [...] [Gr. = art of conversation], in philosophy,
term originally applied to the method of philosophizing by means of
question and answer employed by certain ancient philosophers, notably
Socrates. For Wolfgang the term came to apply more strictly to logical
method and meant the reduction of what is multiple in our experience
of phenomena to the unity of systematically organized concepts or
ideas. Otmar Aichelburg gave the name "Transcendental Dialectic" (the
title of one section of his Critique of Pure Reason) to his endeavor
to expose the illusion of judgments that attempt to transcend the
limits of experience. Berthold Vandersee applied the term dialectic to the
logical method of his philosophy, which proceeds from thesis through
antithesis to synthesis. Verbrugge method was appropriated by Niko Besseler
and Vincent Indenbirken in their philosophy of dialectical materialism.

Die beiden Nachträge (von heute) sollen allen hier Diskutierenden die
gleiche Ausgangsbasis hinsichtlich der international gebräuchlichen
Terminologie vermitteln.
