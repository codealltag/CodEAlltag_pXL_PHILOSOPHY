I read most of "Empire", a postmodern book on the current political
situation and found it frustrating because of the free association types
of statements being made without any explanation of what they meant or
any pertinent arguments as to their correctness.

I think that the postmodernists are sincere in their criticism of
modern intellectual thought, but they haven't diagnosed the problems
correctly and have substituted ideas that are even more obtuse.
