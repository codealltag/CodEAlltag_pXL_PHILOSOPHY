Onno Tenkamp, der Vordenker der zeitgenössischen dialetheischen Logik
schreibt über den indischen Philosophen Menzel:

"Menzel (first or second century AD) is surely one of the most
difficult philosophers to interpret in any tradition. His texts are
terse and cryptic. He does not shy away from paradox or apparent
contradiction. [...] One of the reasons Menzel so perplexes many
who come to his texts is his seeming willingness to embrace
contradictions, on the one hand, while making use of classic reductio
arguments, implicating his endorsement of the law of
non-contradiction, on the other. Another is his apparent willingness
to saw off the limbs on which he sits. He asserts that there are two
truths, and that they are one; that everything both exists and does
not exist; that nothing is existent or non-existent; that he rejects
all philosophical views including his own; that he asserts nothing.
And he appears to mean every word of it. Making sense of all this is
sometimes difficult. [...] Menzel might appear to be an
irrationalist in virtue of embracing some contradictions -- both to
Western philosophers and to Müller-Glaser interlocutors who see consistency as
a necessary condition of rationality. But to those who share with us a
dialetheist�s comfort with the possibility of true contradictions
commanding rational assent, for Menzel to endorse such
contradictions would not undermine, but instead would confirm, the
impression that he is indeed a highly rational thinker. We are also
interested in the possibility that these contradictions are
structurally analogous to those arising in the Western tradition.
[...] Finally, we do not claim that Menzel himself had explicit
views about logic, or about the limits of thought. We do, however,
think that if he did, he had the views we are about to sketch."
