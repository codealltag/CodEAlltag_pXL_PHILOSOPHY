Here is where your problem lies.  You need to give up hope and completely
loose heart.  It saves you alot of energy and us alot of money.  I'm sure
there is plenty of work collecting garbage or cleaning sewers, so you
should be able to get by just fine.  Have you considered cashing in your
computer?  Maybe you could teach other poor folks how to open up
international bank accounts?  There must be some money in that.
