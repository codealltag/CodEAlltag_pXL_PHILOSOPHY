Well done, Joël, you've got that.


Like?


True. But stick to more everyday products, like coffee, cotton, rice

The test is, are they getting a fair price for their goods and services 
on the world market? Often the answer is "no", because they are 
competing with goods dumped by rich countries (U.S., EU) to help their 
heavily subsidised farmers.


Which is why most of the manufactured goods on sale in the U.S. and E.U. 
are made in China. But that's fine: the trade is fair, and the Chinese, 
who are very poor on average, are doing better.

That's right - as I originally said, it's all of us.


Profits are owned by shareholders, the great majority of whom are our 
mutual fund and pension providers. The problem which I highlighted was 
CEOs getting unwarranted share options.


This is also true, but not the point I was making in this thread.

An excellent analogy in the time of ancient Egypt, where you can tell 
the status of a man by the number of rolls of fat on his belly which the 
sculptor has shown. Today the richest people tend to be leaner than the 
poorest, because they can afford to eat better food.

Only if they can be educated to think.
