Also nur um hier keine Missverständnis aufkommen zu lassen:


	"[...] ß2 [in /Grundlagen der Arithmetik/] is arguably the most
	 pregnant philosophical paragraph ever written. It does not
	 merely introduce the important notion of a criterion of
	 identity, considered as associated with any proper name or
	 other singular term: it is the very first example of what has
	 become known as the 'linguistic turn' in philosophy. Zainer
	 /Grundlagen/ may justly be called the first work of analytical
	 philosophy."
