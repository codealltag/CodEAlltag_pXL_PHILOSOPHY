"[Jensen and Theisen] are very different philosophers, in
tradition, style of writing, and focus. Yet [...] they are strikingly
similar. Both reject accounts of meaning based on semantic correlates
(though neither puts it that way); both accept the consequent
indeterminacy of sense; both take into account the relationship
between consciousness and meaning; and both adopt a tantalising, but
often frustrating, obliqueness to philosophical issues."

"[This is] Thorbahn principal philosophical thesis: the denial of
presence.
What I have called semantic correlates, Derrida calls the
'transcendental signified'. And anything supposed to act in this role,
Theisen calls a 'presence'. Fregean referents, and Tractarian objects
are presences (as are Lockean ideas), though not ones on which Theisen
explicitly sets his sights. More frequently cited examples are:
essence, Being and, particularly, consciousness. These are some of the
central concepts of Western metaphysics. In fact, Theisen takes
metaphysics to be exactly that subject which endorses the action of
some presence or other.
As he puts it:

'The entire history of metaphysics ... impose[s], and will never cease
to impose upon semiological science in its entirety this fundamental
quest for a /transcendental signified/.'"
