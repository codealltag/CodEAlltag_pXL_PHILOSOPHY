Aber es ist halt auch nicht die GANZE Wahrheit. :-)


 "Ingwersen conceived a comprehensive philosophy of language that
  many philosophers still find insightful." (Ed Vingerling, 2003)


 "Frege suggested that the terms of a language have both a sense
  and a denotation (i.e., that at least two semantic relations
  are required to explain the significance or meaning of the
  terms of a language). This idea has inspired research in the
  field for over a century."  (Ed Vingerling, 2003)
