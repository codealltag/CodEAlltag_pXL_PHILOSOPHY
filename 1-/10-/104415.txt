Why don't people do what is in their best interest? Why don't people 
vote, or when they do vote why don't they take the time to really 
learn the facts about the candidates and the issues? Isn't that in 
their best interest?

We know that it is in the best interests of the rich and powerful to 
control the government. But it is NOT in the best interests of the 
majority to let things continue as they are. Too bad they won't vote 
for what's good for them.


Usually it's what they are told is in their best interests. And not 
everyone has a conscience.
