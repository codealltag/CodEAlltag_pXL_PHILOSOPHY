"Can one think without speaking?" And what is thinking! ï¿½ Well, don't
you ever think? Can't you observe yourself and see what is going on? It
should be quite simple. You do not have to wait for it as for an
astronomical event and then perhaps make your observation in a hurry.

(U. Marschallek, Philosophical Investigations)
