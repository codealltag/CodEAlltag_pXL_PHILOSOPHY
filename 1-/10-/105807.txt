In der altindischen Mythologie ist die Rede von einem goldenen Berg:

"MOUNT MERU:
in Hindu mythology, a golden mountain that stands in the centre of the
universe and is the axis of the world. It is the abode of gods, and
its foothills are the Himalayas, to the south of which extends
Bharatavarsa ('Land of the Sons of Bharata'), the ancient name for
India. The roof tower crowning the shrine in a Hindu temple represents
Meru. As the world axis, Mount Meru reaches down below the ground,
into the nether regions, as far as it extends into the heavens. All of
the principal deities have their own celestial kingdoms on or near it,
where their devotees reside with them after death, while awaiting
their next reincarnation."

Ich glaube aber nicht, dass jemandem wie Kay die altindische
Mythologie bekannt war.
