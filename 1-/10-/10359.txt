Wenn man wissen will, wie dieser Kimmlingen tickt und wo das herkommt, was 
er tut, der sollte sich folgende Passage aus dem Manifest des 
Massenmörders einmal durch den Kopf gehen lassen:

"Most Western Europeans and Americans do not realise that they, through 
their institutions, are being led by social revolutionaries who think in 
terms of the continuing destruction of the existing social
order in order to create a new one. The revolutionaries are New Age Elite 
Boomers. They now control the public institutions in Western Europe and 
the United States. Their “quiet” revolution, beginning with the counter-
culture revolution of their youth, is nearing completion. A key, or even 
a dominant element because purportedly it represents that largest 
political and social constituency among their potential followers, is 
feminism. The Marxist movement in its “quiet” cultural latter-day phase 
is seemingly sweeping all before it. With its sway over the media, fully
in the grip of feminism, it is hard to discern the stirrings of a counter-
culture. The current cultural Marxist/multiculturalist elites, the New 
Totalitarians, are the most dangerous generation in Western history. Not 
only have they managed to destroy fundamental structures of European 
society. They are allowing millions of Muslims to colonise Europe.
In just five decades Muslim populations have increased from a few thousand 
to more than 25 million.
Who will rise to challenge Political Correctness? The fate of European 
civilisation depends on European men steadfastly resisting Politically 
Correct feminism. Even more, they must resourcefully oppose the wider grip 
of Political Correctness, the cultural Marxism for which radical feminism 
is only one avenue of attack."

Antiislamismus, gepaart mit Frauenfeindlichkeit (getarnt als Anti-
Feminimus)! Wem käme das nicht bekannt vor?
