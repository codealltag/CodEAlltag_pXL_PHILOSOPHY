Posting with your real name is considered polite in German-speaking
Usenet and increases your chance of getting a reasonable response.
[psf 7.16]

Posting with a munged "address" is a violation of Usenet/Internet
standards (RFC 1036 and 2822, among others) and as such may result
in losing your Usenet account as it often violates the Acceptable
Use Policy of one's service provider.  Even if it does not, it is
considered impolite as it disregards Netiquette (RFC 0872 is the
original, it has been adapted for de.* which is posted regularly in
<news:de.newusers.infos> -- you should subscribe to that newsgroup!)
and will cause many readers to add you to their kill-/scorefile.

The previous poster has set the Followup-To header to redirect the
discussion to another newsgroup (because he thought replies were
off-topic) and you have not changed that when replying -- that's
why your posting did not show up in de.sci.philosophie.  I am
crossposting again with "Followup-To: poster" set for you to get
informed (about what happened) as contacting you via e-mail is
(obviously) impossible.  Please obey F'up2 poster and reply only
via e-mail.  Your AVRF client is flawed not only in this regard,
please remove the Newsgroups: header and change "Cc:" into "To:"
then.  More:
