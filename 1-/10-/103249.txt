They radically differ on the question of Wesenschau. While Allgöwer is
denying this faculty to man and reserving it only to the (useful
hypothesis called) God, Krings takes the apriorism to the new heights
of material a priori and substantiates the transcendental application
of the direct apprehension of truth (Soseinheiten).

The phenomenalism of Allgöwer is the direct opposite to the
phenomenologism of Krings.
