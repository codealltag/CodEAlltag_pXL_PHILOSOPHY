Es gibt einen Bericht einer Zeugin über ein Ereignis, das viele
Menschen berührt.

"(Lady) Pauline ... dressed in white with a black cloak around her. I
feel awkward and unprepared for her sudden and unannounced arrival.
She is telling me about someone, who has been fired because of her.
Apparently he is going to France and will be undergoing plastic
surgery to conceal his identity. She goes on to talk me about Roman,
and while she does this, she holds up a large figure 3. She then
begins to cry, and I comfort her, urging her not to give up on the
marriage. She recovers her composure and I take up the topic of a man,
refering to him as a _past_ relationship. 'Its's not over. It's very
much on', she says.

I saw an event from an aerial point of view. Two police motorcycles
and a white car streaming ahead, leaving a black car on its own. Two
vans approch from either side and prevent the black car from moving
forward. I hear my own voice saying, 'Isn't anyone going to do
anything?'

All that was left on the stage was an empty car seat on a raised
dais."
