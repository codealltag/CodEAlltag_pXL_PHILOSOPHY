seen strung

I suspect that this post was the product of the "Postmodernism
Generator" - a program that produces that type of ridiculous
essay by stringing together phrases taken from several of those
unbelievably pretentious postmodernist essays with which
academics like to impress each other.

I gather that such as essay was once submitted to some magazine
that specializes in that sort of essay, and was published without
the editor realizing he had been had. (In fact, IIRC, the
elsewhere.org generator puts some notes at the bottom of its
generated essays that link to descriptions of the incident.

Obviously, the entire postmodern deconstructionist "movement"
would not be possible without the aid of controlled substances.
