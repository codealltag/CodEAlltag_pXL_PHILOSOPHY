Circulus in demonstrando
"This fallacy occurs if you assume as a premise the conclusion which
you wish to reach. Often, the proposition is rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument."
Petitio principii / Begging the question
"This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as
the conclusion reached. Typically the premises of the argument
implicitly assume the result which the argument purports to prove, in
a disguised form."

'Mensch A bekommt seine Identit√§t durch Mensch B und dieser wiederum
durch Mensch A.'
