W.Pressl, "Knots":

I get what I deserve
I deserve what I get.

I have it,
therefore I deserve it

I deserve it
because I have it.

You have not got it
therefore you do not deserve it

You do not deserve it
because you have not got it

You have not got it
because you do not deserve it

You do not deserve it
therefore you have not got it.

Positive and negative binds.

Negative: Cant win. Everything I do is wrong.
Positive: Cant lose. Everything I do is right.

I do it, because it is right.
It is right, because I do it.

All I have has been given me and is mine

If I have it, I must have been given it
Therefore it is mine.

I havent it
but I can get it

therefore,
because I have been given the capacity to get it

it is mine
It is not mine

but it has been given me and I have it
therefore I am grateful for what I have, or
have been given.

But I resent being grateful for what I have, or
have been given.

But I resent being grateful
because if I have been given it, it has not always been mine.

Therefore, if I dont feel grateful

I wont have been given it
therefore, it is (past, present, future) eternally mine.

If I dont know I dont know I
I think I know

If I dont know I know
I think I dont know

Can Bj√∂rn and Wiltrud

terrified that each and the other are not terrified

become

terrified that each and other are terrified, and

eventually,

not terrified that each and other not be terrified?

All in all

Each man in all men
all men in each man

All being in each being
Each being in all being

All in each
Each in all

All distinctions are mind, by mind, in mind, of mind
No distinctions no mind to distinguish

W.Pressl
