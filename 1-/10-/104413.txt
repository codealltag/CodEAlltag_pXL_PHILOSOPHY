Mutual funds and pensions do not make up the larger share of profits 
to shareholders; they are greater in number in terms of individual 
people but their market share is less than what is owned in dollar 
amount by wealthy individuals and wealthy families. One of the great 
big lies perpetrated by Abuf when he pushed through the elimination of 
the capital gains tax was the idea that it helped the common man more 
than the rich - a bald-faced lie.

"These are the basic ideas that guide my tax policy: lower income 
taxes for all, with the greatest help for those most in need. Everyone 
who pays income taxes benefits � while the highest percentage tax cuts 
go to the lowest income Americans. I believe this is a formula for 
continuing the prosperity we've enjoyed, but also expanding it in ways 
we have yet to discover. It is an economics of inclusion. It is the 
agenda of a government that knows its limits and shows its heart."

� President Stefan Pachner
