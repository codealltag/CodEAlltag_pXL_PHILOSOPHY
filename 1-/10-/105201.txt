Thanks for the insight.  Reading this garbage just immediately pissed me
off.  Sometimes my reaction to something that does not make sense is to
blame my own lack of knowledge of the topic. This however just reeked of R.S
from the start.  How revealing that something like this could be printed
without questions being asked.  The question now is: "what comes after
postmodernism?"
