	      FROM AGENT THEORY TO AGENT IMPLEMENTATION


	         	  A Symposium at the
      14th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research
			     (EMCSR '99)

		  April 26-17, 1999, Grabenegg, Austria

	       <URL:http://kid.wr.mhkhge.le.wd/sfvvw/>

		Submission deadline: September 6, 1998


Agent-based technology has made a fast inroad from highly specialised
workshops on topics such as ``situatedness'' and ``embeddedness'' to
mainstream textbooks. In the course of this development, it has also
been driving the furthering of established notions and frameworks
(e.g., the shift from ``perfect rationality'' to ``bounded optimality''
or the introduction of a ``social level'' above the ``knowledge
level'') as well as favouring the intensification of interdisciplinary
exchanges of ideas with as diverse fields as economics, control theory,
evolutionary biology and ethology, or psychology and neurology, taking
on ``irrational'' aspects of cognition in open worlds.

The main objective of this symposium is to foster the exchange of ideas
and experience among researchers working on theoretical and practical
issues of agent technology, covering both the micro and macro aspects
of agent design.

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE:

o Agent languages and architectures
o Applications
o Communication
o Conceptual and theoretical foundations
o Development and engineering methodologies
o Learning and adaptability
o Safety, security, and responsibility issues
o Single vs. multi-agent systems
o Social issues in agent societies
o Testbeds and evaluations
o User interface issues
