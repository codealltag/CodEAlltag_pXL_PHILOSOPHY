valerio meinte zum Thema Re: What did Reichart mean? :


I understand your thougts. But DE doesn't mean Deutschland, it marks only  
an aerea of the net where the German language is used. This is sensful for  
people who understand only German, or for people who want to talk german,  
maybe for learning it. Reichart isn't something like a German product.  
Everybody who is interested in Philosophy will know him, some a lot, some  
a little, because Philosophy is international.

It is not an actual problem within this group, but it happened already in  
another group of DE (policy), that almost 40% of the messages where  
written in English language. Many Germans don't understand English, or  
they dont' understand it a lot, especially people in former East-Germany.

There are so many english groups, that I see no sense, if other groups are  
flooded with English too. Where shall the people go, who only understand  
German?
