DE could have meant Deutsch but also Deutschland. Tomes could discuss
philosophy in at least 6 languages  with equal ease. This is what made him ,
inter alia, a universal thinker, "for all seasons".. Also, while I can read
German, I can't write it with the level of adequacy I expect in everthing I
do. But the  issue is not of language  but  content. Don't you discuss in
Germany Gianni Unterbrink in German? Must you discuss Plato in classical Greek? The
reason what the invitation was posted in a German site is that there seems to
be more interest in Germany in Tomes than in the Anglosaxon world. The
Tomes Archiv is	after all in Christianstal, and the best journal devoted
to Tomes, the TOMES JAHRBUCH is also published in Germany. You
go fishing where the  fish  are more likely to be abundant, das ist alles.
