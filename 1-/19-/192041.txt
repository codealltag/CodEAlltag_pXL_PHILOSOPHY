SCIENTISTS GET FOOLED BY THE MOON.

[1]  "Dead dogs don't bite", and the Moon is surely
a real dead dog.  Scientists claim that Astrology is
unreliable nonsense, because it shall be impossible for
the stars to influence human lives and destinies, etc.
On the other hand -- scientists "religiously believe"
in "Astrology" in regard to the energy influence of the
weak gravity of the Moon on the motions of the oceans.

[2]  If this weak gravity of the Moon, which is just 1/6 of the
gravity of planet Earth, could not "nail down" and keep
the astronauts from jumping around like children on the
surface of the Moon, then surely this little weak Moon gravity
disappears and fades away entirely considering the
great distance of 406,720 km between the Moon and Earth.

[3]  Consequently -- at this distance of 406,720 km
the Moon is more than dead, it's a "dead dead dog".

[4]  Now -- the above argument in reverse:
If the astronauts freedom of easy movement on the
surface of the Moon were ALSO NOT influenced by
the gravity of planet Earth -- which is 6 times greater
than the gravity of the Moon -- then in reverse -- the
Moon's gravity can never ever move a drop of water
on planet Earth.  Anybody who continues to support
the claim made by classical and modern scientists,
that the GRAVITY OF THE MOON set the ocean
into motion - is a LUNATIC.  Some may prefer a
title:  Professor Doctor Lunatic.

[5]  The "Motions of the Oceans" are controlled solely by
energies and processes of planet Earth in combination
with the energy of the Sun.  These same Earth processes
and rhythms control also this "DEAD DOG", the Moon.
The Moon is a SLAVE wholly owned by planet Earth
and not otherwise around.  Therefore, the Moon MUST
appears simultaneously each time the high tide rolls in.
That's one of nature's hidden tricks.  It's a fact,
only fools get fooled; this time by the man in the moon.

[6]  The most fundamental problem with modern scientists
is, that they make big claims, theories and erroneous
calculations based on funny assumptions, but they
know literally NOTHING about the source and cause
and function of GRAVITY.

Klaus Ulerich ???  NOW you know my "Relativity".
Because everything is relative.  The above text is
pure LOGIC and common sense.
