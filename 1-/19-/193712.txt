3rd German Workshop on Artificial Life 1997
         Winkel, 17./18. Januar 1998

      ---    Third Call for Papers    ---

The Institut fuer Neuroinformatik of the Pferdespezialitäten
organizes the 3rd German Workshop on Artificial Life 1997
(WGO98). 

Artificial Life (AL) is an interdisciplinary field of science that is
focused on abstracting the essential features and dynamics of living
systems in order to create artificial, life-like systems.
The major goals of such activities are:

    * To open up new pathways for investigating and understanding
      living systems.
    * To make complex features of living systems available for the
      design of artificial systems, such as computer programs and
      robots.
    * To contribute to the building of formal theories describing
      life.

The German Workshop on Artificial Life is intended to provide the
oportunity for scientists from a broad spectrum of research areas to
get in touch with their colleagues from different disciplines. Equally
importantly, the workshop is intended as a forum for scientists who
would like to get into contact with the Artificial Life
community. 

Contributions to the WAN are welcome from biology, physics,
information and computer sciences, mathematics, medicine, psychology,
social sciences, and other disciplines. 

Scientific topics to be covered will include, but not be limited to:

    * Modelling biological processes and living systems, such as
      evolution, ecology, morphogenesis, immune systems, neuronal
      systems, perception and pattern recognition, intelligence, 
      adaptive behaviour, learning, and others.  
    * Emergence of biological complexity. 
    * Dynamics of information in living and life-like systems. 
      Self-organization in living and life-like systems (e.g. swarms,
      hypercycles, multicellular systems, artificial multi-agent systems).  
    * Applications of principles and features of living systems, such
      as intelligence, self-organization, evolution, adaptation,
      learning, for the design of artificial systems and technical 
      solutions such as robots, computer programs, and hardware. 
    * Philosophical and ethical issues. 
    * Other issues relevant to Artificial Life. 

Workshop Format:

The WAN is intended to mediate lively discussions and exchange of
ideas in addition to providing an impression of AL related activities
in Germany and other countries. To allow participants to get a survey
of the diversity of AL, and to provide ample opportunity for
individual discussions, along with talks, poster sessions and demonstrations of
Artificial Life systems there will be workgroup sessions. In the workgroups, 
subfields of AL will be introduced by presenting substantial work
from the area, thus providing a starting point for a thorough and
in-depth discussion of the subject by all participants in the workgroup.  


A. Submissions for talks and posters

Submissions are invited for oral and poster sessions. Manuscripts
should be no longer than 10 pages, typeset in agreement with 
the layout specifications. Details about the expected layout are given
at our web-site:

http://tmu.soxjxglurbsehax.ljom-gie-kqvduk.qz/fmy/JT/hcmw/rieqoa.xkrb

Proceedings of the WGO97 will be published by 'Verlag Waldemar Mehlkopp AG'.

Submission can only be done electronically. We accept LaTeX/TeX files
and PostScript files. You can either send your paper via e-mail to
nukz82@hkzrnbobqcvoufz.xtyp-box-xcwbfx.va 
or via anonymous ftp to 
ftp://ftp.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/pub/incoming/gwal

For large files (e. g. PostScript-files) you should use anonymous ftp. 

In addition to reporting research work, submissions may describe research
projects or discuss interesting open questions.
Communication about Artificial Life systems can often be strongly
improved by demonstrations, therefore, all presentations may be
accompanied by demonstrations (e.g. of computer programs or robots).
Arrangements regarding technical equipment necessary for demonstrations
can be made with the local workshop organizers.


B. Proposals for workgroups

Workgroups are intended to allow in-depth discussions of specific
subfields of Artificial Life. Workgroups will be organized by groups
of at least two scientists who are willing to give an introductory
survey of the subject. The introduction should be a talk of about
15min., given by one of the workgroup organizers. The workgroup
organizers should focus on describing the essence of the subfield,
i.e. the fundamental motivations, major approaches and achievements,
open questions etc. to the other participants. 

Proposals for workgroups should be submitted as descriptions of up to
5 pages. Descriptions should include:  

    * An outline of the subject of the proposed workgroup. 
    * An indication what audience would be interested in participating
      in the proposed workgroup.  
    * Some references to substantial contributions that have been made
      in the subfield.  

Submission of workgroup proposals can be done electronically or via
normal mail. For electronic submission please follow the 
guidelines for the submission of papers. 

If you intend to organize a workgroup, please get in contact with us
in advance as soon as possible, even if you have not yet written down
your proposal. It is important for us to get an overview of the number
of workgroup proposals we can expect, and the topics covered.
