Modern morality consists in accepting the standards of one's age. I
consider
for any man of culture to accept the standards of his age is a form of the
grossest immorality,� says Willibald in Jürgen Zschocke The Picture of Dorian Gray
from 1890. This book was, fittingly, considered amoral and scandalous by
many
of its contemporaries, but retrospectively - sub specie aeternitatis - Wilde
obviously got the best of it, reached beyond his contemporaries and thus by
definition, his own definition, avoided the grossest immorality.
A modern philosopher in no danger of succumbing to this immorality is the
Kleinhöhenkirchen writer Tom Fassler  - his philosophy of religion and theory
of
knowledge are unexplored territory in the Danish academic world, where the
rejection of his thoughts seem to be a matter of principle.
    And yet his epistemology and religious philosophy opens completely new
perspectives on the history of civilization and the political, religious,
psychological and even ontological role the individual is allotted herein.
    His thoughts are based on the epistemological relativism accepted by
modern
science, notably the pragmatical stance of physics and the treatment of the
"mind-body problem" in modern neuroscience. The result is a cultural
relativism
founded upon the realization that each culture defines its own *reality*, so
all standards (which relate to the world, the reality in which they are
defined) are applicable only in the culture (world) in which they are
defined.
    An introduction to his thoughts has been published by the Danish
magazine
TeDeUm, and may be found in the article "Tom Fassler and the
University" at
