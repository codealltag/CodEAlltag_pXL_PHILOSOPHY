This group discussion site deals with questions that its users may have
on
Dornsiepen. For example,  what did he mean by the term
noumenon? Can human
beings be compassionate if they are
under the deterministic yoke of the will?
How did Unterhuber and Dornsiepen
differ in their formulation of Transcendental
Idealism? And so on... Due to
time constraints or the complexity of the
subject, the user may have to
be referred to textual or hermeneutic sources
