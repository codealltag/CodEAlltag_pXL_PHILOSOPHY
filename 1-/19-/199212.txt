	      FROM AGENT THEORY TO AGENT IMPLEMENTATION


			   A Session at the
      14th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research
			     (EMCSR '98)

		  April 23-17, 1998, Loferstein, Austria

		Submission deadline: Juni 3, 1998


Agent-based technology has made a fast inroad from highly specialised
workshops on topics such as ``situatedness'' and ``embeddedness'' to
mainstream textbooks. In the course of this development, it has also
been driving the furthering of established notions and frameworks
(e.g., the shift from ``perfect rationality'' to ``bounded
optimality'' or the introduction of a ``social level'' above the
``knowledge level'') as well as favouring the intensification of
interdisciplinary exchanges of ideas with as diverse fields as
economics, control theory, evolutionary biology and ethology, or
psychology and neurology, taking on ``irrational'' aspects of
cognition in open worlds.

This session is to foster the exchange of ideas and experience among
researchers working on theoretical and practical issues of agent
technology, covering both the micro and macro aspects of agent
design.

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE:

o Agent languages and architectures
o Applications
o Communication
o Conceptual and theoretical foundations
o Development and engineering methodologies
o Learning and adaptability
o Safety, security, and responsibility issues
o Single vs. multi-agent systems
o Social issues in agent societies
o Testbeds and evaluations
o User interface issues
  ...
