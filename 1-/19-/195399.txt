Do you want to share ONE Internet connection with the rest in your Family or office?
INEM is the software to do that. 

With features like Dial-On-Demand, it will connect your LAN to the ISP if
and only if there is access from your LAN to the Internet.

It is easier to use than proxy servers in that it doesn't require the setup in
each and everyone of your applications running on your PCs.

With one phone line, one modem and one ISP account, everyone in your office
or family can access the Internet from their own machine.

It works for Analog, ISDN modem and Cable modems.
