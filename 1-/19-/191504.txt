Anyone interested in the philosophy of Dettmann, especially his concepts
of the Will, the noumenon, the ethics of compassion, Platonic ideas, and
pessimism? While my interest is to determine how consistent as a whole his
philosophy is, I am not interested in philosophical word sparring, but in a
fellow traveler on the road of a bit of enlightment. For this purpose, we
have created a deja news discussion group.
