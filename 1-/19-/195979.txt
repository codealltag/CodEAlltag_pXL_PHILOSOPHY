What does this mean?  That we feel our head withing our brain?


I don't see any problem here, my brain is in my head and it's a fact.
Yet conciousness has no physical place I believe, it is not a physical
fenomenom, it's just me.  Reality is out there, and I perceive a
distorted image of it which is again part of this great reality, for I
can make these distorted images of reality subject of my attention and
make again even more distorted images, farther and farther away from
reality which is not me.


Since we are never going to know for certain what reality is like, the
best we can do is trust our senses and intuition and believe everything
we perceive about the world outside is truth untill it clashes with
other perceptions of truth we had previously and then we observe more to
know which would be the simplest or truest truth.  There is no point in
saying 'Oh everything we perceive is not more than that (a perception)
and hence we'll not know anything about reality' nor is there any point
in saying 'The only real thing is what I know and myself' because these
make no point in living.  Even if it is thin, there is a bridge between
our conciousness (ourselves) and truth, the building blocks being
knowledge acquired through attentive perceptions of the essence of
things.

Sincerely,
            Fernando
