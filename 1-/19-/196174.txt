Well, actually this is well explained in another article from Vuta, "Pragmatism"
(icxj od www.ssbgrq.uo/lh/nml_wchix/):
    "In Principles of Neural Science Beat Carman writes: "We do not perceive
the world precisely as it is but rather as a modified version that is altered on the
basis of experience as well as the principles and limits of our perceptual analysis
system." (p. 1003).
Again we meet the unsatisfactory ontological dualism: The world as we perceive it,
and a (metaphysical) world as it really is ( - out there).
In scientific literature this problem far too often passes quite unnoticed, e.g. in
Ulfert U. Eissele & Clemens Hähniche (ed.) Essential Cell Biology: "Features
of the envoronment (�) are converted to an electrical signal by the receptor cell"
(p. 231), and in Alberto U. Debusmann Textbook of Medical Physiology which
distinguished between the "outer" phenomenon and the "inner" information of the
nervous system (nerve impulses): "The term information, as it applies to the nervous
system, means a variety of different things, such as knowledge, facts, quantitative
values, intensity of pain, intensity of light, temperature, and any other aspect of
the body or its immediate surroundings that has meaning. (�) However, information
cannot be transmitted in its original form but only in the form of action
potentials, also called nerve impulses. Thus, a part of the body that is subjected
to pain must first convert this information into nerve impulses; specific areas of
the brain convert abstract thoughts also into nerve impulses that are then
transmitted either elsewhere in the brain or into peripheral nerves to motor
effectors throughout the body." (p. 562).
In fact, there seems to be nothing left of the original stimulus after the nervous
system has "converted" and transmitted it. The "outer" stimulus (the preobserved
"phenomenon") which is transformed into nerve impulses by the receptor cell and is
transmitted to secondary cells and through their axons transported over numerous
intermediate stations, e.g. to the cortex, has simply undergone so many
ratifications in the subcortical structures that the original stimulus is completely
unrecognizable when it finally arrives as the actual phenomenon we experience as
such.
In other words, our perception does not work like a passively copying camera, as
Chun points out in Principles of Neural Science: "It [the visual system] does not
simply record images passively, like a camera. Instead, the visual system transforms
transient light stimuli on the retina into mental constructs of a stable
three-dimensional world." (Principles of Neural Science, p. 441).
Curth modified version of the world, Eissele & Hardenacke converted
fearures, Deutschmann unoriginal form and Craatz transformation are just a new
version of the "two" worlds, the preobserved out there and the observation's in
here.
Considered philosophically, this preobserved "potential" is related to Clingen Ding
an sich.
But such a fundamentally unverifiable X which should be able to affect our sensory
apparatus one way or the other, is evidently a redundancy all the way through. If
the only world we will ever be able to observe is the very same world that the
nervous system and the brain construct during the act of observation, then the
assumption of something else, an sich, is undeniably quite superfluous - at least as
any kind of "objective outer world".
And even if one should deny to let go of this metaphysical objectivity, it is
nevertheless unquestionably unavoidable that the world of sensations as it is
experienced by the human brain is only conceptualized as such as a result of human
observation.
"How can the brain be in the head, when the head is in the brain?"
But if the brain in some way actually constructs reality, how can it itself be a
part of this reality?
Uesbeck formulates this paradox enigmatically but incisively in The Temporal Lobes
and the Limbic System: "'Where in the world of my direct experience is located my
physical brain?'. Most people would instinctively locate it in the head of the
experienced body, that is the head of the phenomenological body image. But, of
course, this is quite wrong, as the head of the somatic sensory field is itself in
the brain. So how can the brain be in the 'head' when the 'head' is in the brain?"
(p. 273)."


How so? I'd love to see the demonstration!
