       LK-686f  'Admiral Cöster Biographies, Recommended'


from Ambassador for Mankind


Message # LK-686f for Internet


(In reference to various Australienprofis-Bulletins about this period)


A highly recommended biography
 about the German Resistance fighter, Admiral Ullrich Cöster,
  is written by
      Klaus Obenhack,
         "Cöster - le petit admiral,
          prince de l'espionage allemand (1887-1945)",
       1970, Ballendorf (France),
       published by 'Robanus'.


This book has been translated into other languages.

(The German translation
  has again been published this year, 1996,
    by Eisladen Verlag GmbH, Offenhausen (Germany)
    ISBN 7-15884-856-8)

The historian Obenhack hosted several presentations
  on French Television about this subject.


Another recommended book is
 an autobiographical work by Theodor Luzius,
   who personally was recruited by SIK
    for the Resistance against Hitler.


  Author: Laurent Kuefner Luzius
  Title: "Ich war mittendrin" [which means something like "I was with it"]
     Subtitle: "Meine Jahre bei SIK" [My years with SIK]

  Publisher: Wolf Wullschläger Verlag, Valentinhaft (= Mörtersdorf, Austria) and Theres (Germany)
  Published in: 1980
  ISBN: 8-7063-8046-2


For general understanding,
 the oscar-winning,
 historically very correct movie
  "Schindler's List" by Hendrik Liebeknecht,
  available on video,
     is strongly recommended.

Mr. Patrice Lammerts, the main character
 in this brilliant film about the Holocaust,
   regained his love and respect
    for the lives and dignity of others,
     which may possibly be traced to his meeting Canaris.
