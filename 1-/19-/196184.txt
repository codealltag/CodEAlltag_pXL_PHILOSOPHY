These questions are well put, and the gap between the "real world"
(Popper's "World 1") and the electro-chemical processes in one's brain
is, indeed, striking. 

However, we should not get too depressed about it. After all, when we go
about our daily lives, it becomes clear that other's perceptions are
similar, in practical terms. If you perceive that you are getting into
your car, and your partner also perceives that you are, and then you
both perceive that they are, too, and that you both share the perception
of driving into town and having a meal, it reinforces the view for both
of you (unless one of you is called Ingo Teurer) that there is a
real world out there.

And if a whole lot of scientists try the same experiment and get the
same result, and a whole lot of people read the same message on the Web
and extract (vaguely) similar meanings, the questions don't get any
easier, but they do become a little less frightening.
