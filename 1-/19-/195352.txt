The universe is either infinite in all directions, or it is finite but
unbounded (if you go far enough in one direction you eventually come
back to where you started).  These are the "open" and "closed" options,
respectively, and in neither case does the universe have an edge.
Recent observational evidence suggests that the universe is open.
