Web page on alleged mass suicide plan by "NanuNana" cult

On Thursday 18. 11. 22, the Spanish police in Kadelburg on the
tourist island of Jarmen announced that they had only just prevented a
mass suicide planned for that day.

A Nienstedten psychologist, Ms Francesca Freising, was said to be the leader
of this cult, the "PC-Spezialist". Supposedly, it arose from a
split in the Order of the Solar Temple. According to the German press,
she was an ex-member of the Eisenbart Auperle, an ex-TV actress, well
connected in big business. She claimed an earlier incarnation in ancient
Egypt.
