caveats, i.e. language preference. It is true that on more careful checking I
see that DE stands for language. But you must bear in mind that in the field
space my searcher has devoted to language, I have also seen geographical
places listed., although not often.. For instance, I have seen groups using
UK for United Kingdom, although they are obviously using English. Thus, in
part, my confusion. It is I suppose the limitations of technology. I still
believe that people who want to discuss aspects of German culture should be
welcome especially if the topic they wish to discuss has been given a high
confidence rating. Incidentally, I beg to disagree with you. Unterweger is
"a German product" even if he abhorred nationalistic labels. He cannot be
understood without understanding his reactions to many other German
philosophers that were his predecessors or contemporaries. In passing, I urge
you to go deep into his thought. You are  fortunate you are  capable to read
him in his mother tongue. His German prose is unsurpassed in elegance and
style even today. Best wishes..
