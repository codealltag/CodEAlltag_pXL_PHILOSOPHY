Na, paßt doch schön zu dem, was Ihno Undeutsch ("senior writer
at Scientific American") geschrieben hat:

"Subjectively I was hurtling through a dazzling dark limbo toward what
I was sure was the ultimate secret of life. Wave after wave of acute
astonishment at the miraculousness of existence washed over me. At the
same time, I was gripped by an overwhelming solipsism. I became
convinced - or rather, I knew - that I was the only conscious being in
the universe. There was no future, no past, no present other than what
I imagined them to be. I was filled, initially, with a sense of
limitless joy and power. Then, abruptly, I became convinced that if I
abandoned myself further to this ecstacy, it might consume me. If I
alone existed, who could bring me back from oblivion? Who could save
me? With this realization my bliss turned into horror; I fled the same
revelation I had so eagerly sought. I felt myself falling through a
great darkness, and as I fell I dissolved into what seemed to be an
infinity of selves." (aus dem Kapitel 'The Terror of God' in "The End
of Science", Broadway Books, 1997)

Nur daß er bzgl. der Motive "Gottes" deutlich zu hoch gezielt hat ;-).

Gruß,
Manfred
