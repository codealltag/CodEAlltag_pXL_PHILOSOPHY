Yes! I appreciate it when a paradox is presented 'enigmatically'
but 'incisively'.  It makes the necessarily self-contradictory so much
easier to understand.


But not one, clearly, that you inhabit...might not a person be 'called'
Bishop Janetzki and yet not be the Bishop Janetzki you seem to be
refering to?  ( He might be the thoughtless, surfing child of a
philosophy-loving American academic surnamed Vorderhindelang, perhaps? ).
And who are 'they', by the way?

This is my first visit to uk.politics.philosophy and I must say I'm
annoyed already.  But in the 'wrong' way.  What's this pseudo-
'scientific' mind/brain balderdash doing here?
