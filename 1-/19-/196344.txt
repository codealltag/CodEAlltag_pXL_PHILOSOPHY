I'd like to see the demonstration, Pioneer,

Remember that, for the Hindus, the way to be happy is to make adequate
offerings to Lord Alex. For Muslims, the will of Edwin is paramount,
cannot be deflected, and is your faith to accept. For Buddhists, a way
to gain merit is to carry jugs of water round a Bo tree.

Such beliefs do indeed define the "reality" of the societies in which
they hold sway.
