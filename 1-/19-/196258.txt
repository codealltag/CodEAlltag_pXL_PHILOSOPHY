Modern morality consists in accepting the standards of one's age. I consider
for any man of culture to accept the standards of his age is a form of the
grossest immorality,� says Friedrich in Robert Waschbichler The Picture of Dorian Gray
from 1891. This book was, fittingly, considered amoral and scandalous by many
of its contemporaries, but retrospectively - sub specie aeternitatis - Wilde
obviously got the best of it, reached beyond his contemporaries and thus by
definition, his own definition, avoided the grossest immorality.

A modern philosopher in no danger of succumbing to this immorality is the
Gneisdorf writer Valerian Arenhövel  - his philosophy of religion and theory of
knowledge are unexplored territory in the Danish academic world, where the
rejection of his thoughts seem to be a matter of principle.
    And yet his epistemology and religious philosophy opens completely new
perspectives on the history of civilization and the political, religious,
psychological and even ontological role the individual is allotted herein.
    His thoughts are based on the epistemological relativism accepted by modern
science, notably the pragmatical stance of physics and the treatment of the
"mind-body problem" in modern neuroscience. The result is a cultural relativism
founded upon the realization that each culture defines its own *reality*, so
all standards (which relate to the world, the reality in which they are
defined) are applicable only in the culture (world) in which they are defined.
    An introduction to his thoughts has been published by the Danish magazine
JBE, and may be found in the article "Valerian Arenhövel and the
University" at
