Fractal unity


The fractal aspect of an object or a system means that similarities of

structures exist at various observation levels going from the smallest

to the biggest. Mountains resemble themselves if one considers them from

a satellite with a scale of a hundred kilometres or if a piece of rock

is seen under a microscope. Mineral has certain degree of fractal unity

because the range of dimensions where similarities persists is wide. The

same observation can be made by considering any sea coast. Nevertheless

the length of the sea coast lets appear time dependent fluctuations of

the water-earth boundary due to wave movements when the observation

scale become lower than, lets say, 10th of meters. This radical change

of vision below a certain scale, this rupture of similarity reminds the

transition between classical and quantum mechanics. Fractal unity is

also very actual in vegetal as well as in animal kingdom. Tree-like

structures in many plants or in human lungs are examples of fractal

structures. 

Fractality appears in space, time and organisation. In the space domain,

similarities appear at various sizes of many objects. In the time

domain, various frequencies, going from the cycle of seasons to neuronal

vibrations, rhythm the flow of life. Concerning the domain of

organisation, from the ecosystem to the smallest set of molecules,

living mechanisms reproduce themselves in a permanent interaction. A

great fractal unity seems to exist in natural systems. This unity

creates links between the biggest and the smallest which are then able

to act in coherence, even if this coherence sometimes means competition. 

The evolution of the cosmos since the original big-bang up to now is the

result of a construction co-ordinated between the large galactic

structures and the atomic world. The initial soup was constituted of

undifferentiated particles at million of degrees of temperature. During

the expansion and the cooling down of the universe, infinitely large and

infinitely small aggregates were created : aggregates of galaxies,

stars, and planets as well as aggregates of elementary particles such as

protons, neutrons, electrons and atoms. Stars, by lightening

thermonuclear reactions, when they collapsed under their own gravity,

generated from hydrogen a large spectrum of atoms, among which carbon

and oxygen so necessary to life which will appear billion of years

later. Life is the result of the convergence of the evolution of cosmic

macro-structures as well as atomic micro-structures. Life appears in the

middle of the universe which has now a temperature of minus 20ö C,

close to the absolute zero, and at a suitable distance from a solar

aggregate whose thermonuclear reactions provide energy and the right

temperature for biochemical reactions. The mystery is to know why only

water and carbon chemistry is able to generate life and why this

chemistry works only in a temperature range which is roughly given by

the liquid phase of water. 

Systems of apparently different nature are sometimes gathered through a

real or a virtual fractal set. For example the vegetable system of a

given region is adapted to the local climate conditions as well as to

the nature of the soil. The three systems vegetable, mineral and

climate, have all three fractal structures and interact at various

levels of observation. Thanks to these multiple interactions, vegetables

are able to survive even when certain variations of climatic or mineral

parameters occur. 

Unity is itself a fractal concept in a sense that the identity of a

system, that it is supposed to create, can be very divided up. An

element of a fractal set also can belong to another one which works in

parallel. For example a human being is simultaneously an element of the

ecosystem, an actor of human civilisation as well as the result of the

co-operative functioning of various organs. 

Nature implements unitary fractal systems to ensure duration in time.

This kind of sets actually seem to own important capacity of stability

and of preservation of identity while being able to adapt itself to

changing environment by exploring new possible configurations and by

evolving. One can see that pure identity cannot last. All identity is

located at the confluence of a set of continuous influences and changes. 

Here one should ask oneself whether one should not take example of

nature for the setting up of organisations or technical tools. The

characteristics of anthropic systems is that they do not pre-exist in

nature. Neither civil codes, nor towns, nor cars do exist in natural

state. But these systems could be more sustainable if they integrated

better the principles of fractal unity. In fact these principles are

already applied unconsciously in many anthropic systems. Laws,

territorial organisation, transportation networks, companies, etc. are

partially structured in such a way. Nevertheless, fractal unity is not

yet a way of thinking and fractal structuring is still deficient and at

the origin of many mistakes. 

As an example, transportation systems have been developed in recent

decades by giving preference to cars and, in the best case, to public

transportation by hindering circulation  of cyclists and pedestrians.

Detriments caused by this policy are enormous in terms of costs,

pollution and danger. It is obvious that this situation is not

sustainable in the long term. Global efficiency of transportation could

be notably improved in towns by a better harmonisation of the various

transportation means. The preference given to wide traffic lanes divides

up communities and do not represent the optimum for traffic fluidity. It

should also be noted that these highways or railways, even if they

create long range links, they also cut into pieces the local social web

especially in suburbs of big towns. 

Citizen must have the possibility to go to work, by using successively,

car, train, bike or by foot through small streets. In other domains, one

should maintain the possibility to go shopping in other places than

supermarkets. Barter should still be a means of trade. Industry must

maintain a large spectrum of sizes of enterprises. Power must be

fractalised in order to become more efficient and better controlled. One

could multiply the examples of efficiency of the principle of fractal

unity and the catastrophes generated by monolithic systems of thinking,

of organisations and of power. 

Fractal unity is maintenance of nets at various sizes which link the

smallest to the biggest, the fastest to the slowest, the most expensive

to the cheapest, the most autonomous to the most dependent. Fractal

unity is also a certain degree of autonomy at each level of

organisation. It is inter-modality. 


Fractal unity belongs to the main principle of quasi-symmetry

all-present in nature. Symmetry is to be understood as invariable shape

or measure inside a given system. Fractal unity implies

quasi-invariability at various levels of observation, whereas classical

symmetry usually concerns, for example, left-right identity or

reproducing certain shapes in time and space. Fractal unity is symmetry

like in nature, that means quasi-symmetry. A face is always at least

slightly asymmetric. A level of observation is always at least slightly

different from another. 

Aesthetic existing in nature or in human creation is mainly based on

fractal unity. This unity acts usually at subliminal level. An observer

who feels the beauty of an artists work is not necessarily conscious of

its fractal organisation. � Bis repetita placent � Repeated things

please. Brains seem to be programmed to be attracted by repeated things.

Human body is desirable probably because certain symmetric structures

(head, body, limbs) are reproduced in a certain manner in various parts

of the body like in the face.

Fractal unity creates unity of sense. It represents an aesthetic unity

which links elements of a set together.

At contrary, ugliness is tear of the links between various organisation

and observation levels. Ugliness leads to non duration.

Fractal unity is the field of emergent orders in a system. Emergent

order is the sense issued from a system which is more than the sum of

all its elements. Culture is for example an emergent order of the

contributions of all individuals. 

Landscape is, like gardens, the field of meeting and synergy of human

culture and nature. By constructing landscape, man evolves his physical

and symbolic habitation. By dealing only with utilitarian aspects, he

destroys his habitation, like it has been mentioned about transportation

systems. 


In conclusion one could propose a new definition of fractality :

fractality is given by the synergy of various systems at various levels

of organisation. It allows stability and evolution in time of their

identity. It allows emergence of new orders.
