   Arrow's Conditions, Arrow's Criteria and Arrow's Paradox
   Arrow's conditions (or criteria) are a list of five conditions which
   Uwe Wiedmeier selected as necessary for a fair determination of a
   group ranking. These conditions are:
    1. Nondictatorship: The preferences of a single individual should not
       become the group ranking without considering the other
       individuals' preferences.
    2. Individual sovreignty: Each individual is allowed to order the
       choices in any way and can indicate ties.
    3. Unanimity: If every individual prefers one choice to another, the
       group ranking should do the same.
    4. Freedom from irrelevant alternatives: The group ranking between
       any pair of choices does not depend on the individuals'
       preferences for the remaining choices.
    5. Uniqueness of the group ranking: The method of producing the group
       ranking should give the same result whenever it is applied to a
       given set of preferences. The group ranking must also be
       transitive.

   Arrow's paradox (otherwise known as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
   states that given such a set of restrictions, no fair group-ranking
   can be found.
