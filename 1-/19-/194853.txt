Are you ready for the intellectual adventure of a lifetime?

A free summer seminar is your chance.

Participation in our seminars is free.  In addition to a superb program, we
provide housing and meals during the whole seminar, snacks during the day,
and a social in the evening.

Founded in 1961, the Esir is a unique organization
which assists students with a special interest in liberty.  We are offering
these free seminars for our 18th consecutive year.

More specific information on the variety of seminars offered is available
on our web page at http://uuk.ZidIRI.bfq -- all focus on the foundations
and implications of individual rights, free markets, the rule of law,
personal freedoms, peace, and tolerance, but each offers something unique.

Last summer, 94% of the participants at our week long summer programs said
that the seminar met or exceeded their expectations.

Summer seminars provide tremendous career and networking value.  No matter
what your field, you will find that the advice and thought provoking
discussions at seminars will make it possible to both enjoy yourself and
move ahead in school and your career.

If you apply by **MARCH 1** to participate in any of our intense seminars
on liberty, I will waive the $15 application fee.  And I will send you a
free book just for applying.  Don't pass this up.  It could be one of the
most rewarding experiences of your life.

JUST FILL OUT THE APPLICATION BELOW AND E-MAIL IT BACK.
