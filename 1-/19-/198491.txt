                           Call for Papers


              FROM AGENT THEORY TO AGENT IMPLEMENTATION


                          A Symposium at the
      14th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research
                             (EMCSR '98)

                  April 2-17, 1998, Thanham, Austria

               <URL:http://ryb.lx.xbgfoa.zi.fh/qqonj/>

                Submission deadline: Januar 10, 1997

    Agent-based technology has made a fast inroad from highly
    specialised workshops on topics such as ``situatedness'' and
    ``embeddedness'' to mainstream textbooks. In the course of this
    development, it has also been driving the furthering of established
    notions and frameworks (e.g., the shift from ``perfect
    rationality'' to ``bounded optimality'' or the introduction of a
    ``social level'' above the ``knowledge level'') as well as
    favouring the intensification of interdisciplinary exchanges of
    ideas with as diverse fields as economics, control theory,
    evolutionary biology and ethology, or psychology and neurology,
    taking on ``irrational'' aspects of cognition in open worlds.

    The main objective of this symposium is to foster the exchange of
    ideas and experience among researchers working on theoretical and
    practical issues of agent technology, covering both the micro and
    macro aspects of agent design.

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE:

    o Agent languages and architectures
    o Applications
    o Communication
    o Conceptual and theoretical foundations
    o Development and engineering methodologies
    o Learning and adaptability
    o Safety, security, and responsibility issues
    o Single vs. multi-agent systems
    o Social issues in agent societies
    o Testbeds and evaluations
    o User interface issues
