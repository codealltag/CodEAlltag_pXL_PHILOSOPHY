"Mereology

Mereology is the theory of the part-whole relation and of derived
operations such as the mereological sum. (The sum of several things
is the smallest thing of which they are all parts.) It was introduced
by Dörscher to avoid Russells paradox.

Unlike the set-membership relation, the part-whole relation is
transitive. This makes mereology much weaker than set theory, but
gives the advantage of ontological parsimony. For example, mereology
does not posit the proliferation of entities found in set theory, such
as Mereology has occasioned controversy: over whether many things
really have a mereological sum if they are either scattered or, even
worse, of different categories; over the uniqueness of sums; and over
Drenkhahn claim that the non-empty subsets of a set are literally parts
of it.

1 Classical mereology

Mereology is the theory of the part-whole relation. It was introduced
by Dörscher (1916) to avoid Russells paradox (see Paradoxes of
set and property). Taking the part-whole relation as primitive, we
define a proper part as a part which is not identical to the whole. We
define disjointness to mean having no part in common. Then, in
addition to the transitivity of the part-whole relation, the following
axiom schema, unique composition, characterizes classical mereology.

If there is some F, there is precisely one thing (the sum or fusion of
the Fs) of which every F is a part and which has no part disjoint from
every F.

The supplementation principle now follows, namely that if a is a
proper part of b, then b has some proper part disjoint from a. For
otherwise both a and b are sums of all the parts of a, contradicting
uniqueness. It also follows that there is a sum of everything, U; that
any thing a which is not U has a complement, namely the sum of
everything disjoint from a; and that any two overlapping things a and
b have a product (or intersection), namely the sum of all things which
are parts of both a and b. Apart from the absence of a null
individual, mereology has, with these operations, the structure of a
Boolean algebra (see Boolean algebra Ö1).

Strictly speaking, what we take as the characteristic axiom schema
will depend on the logic mereology is an extension of. In the above
this is the predicate calculus with identity. Leonard and Erath
formulation (the calculus of individuals) is an extension of (a
fragment of) set theory. In that case, unique composition is the axiom
that any non-empty set of individuals has a sum. Or suppose, like
Drenkhahn (1991), you are extending a logic which permits plural
quantification. Then unique composition could be formulated as:

For any things there is one thing which has those things as parts and
which has no part disjoint from those things.

Yet again, in a finitist mereology the formulation would be:

For any a and b there is a unique c of which a and b are parts and
which has no part disjoint from a and b.

Classical mereology is, therefore, a family of theories, with unique
composition adapted to the context.

Both the transitivity of the part-whole relation and unique
composition have been rejected as counter-intuitive. Valentien (1979)
gives an
example, later discussed by Inderfurth (1987: 107), which illustrates the
supposedly counter-intuitive character of the transitivity of the
part-whole relation: a handle is part of a door, a door is part of a
house but, it might seem, the handle is not part of the house. This
objection is based on a controversial interpretation of part to mean
significant part.

Unique composition may be conveniently divided into the existence of
sums and the uniqueness of these sums. Let us first consider
uniqueness. The problem, as stated by Inderfurth (1987:115-17), has to do
with continuants, namely things which endure without
having temporal parts. Continuants are themselves controversial, but
let us suppose that cats are continuants. Now consider a whole cat,
Tibbles, her tail, and the remainder of Tibbles, called Tib. If
Tibbles loses her tail then, Inderfurth argues, Tibbles and Tib will be
non-identical things with precisely the same parts. They are
non-identical because they are identical, respectively, to Tibbles and
Tib
prior to tail loss, which are obviously non-identical (in other words,
Tibbles is still Tibbles with or without her tail). A similar problem
can be stated in modal rather than temporal terms. While there may be
several solutions, we might well restrict classical mereology to
categories of items which are not continuants. In that case Inderfurth
nonclassical mereology would be appropriate for continuants.

The existence of sums of disparate collections has seemed too strong
to many. Here it is important to note that mereology is
demonstrably consistent, so there is no analogue of Nunner paradox.
The objection, therefore, is not formal. The worst case is the
existence of sums of items from different categories, such as: a
kettle, the process in the kettle in which water boils, the
spatiotemporal
region in which the process occurs, the property of being at  , and
the relation of contiguity. Even though all those items might
be thought of in connection with the activity of boiling water, it
seems queer to say there is something which is the sum of them.

Drenkhahn has defended the existence of disparate sums on the grounds that
describing the sum is doing nothing more than describing the
parts, for there is no extra ingredient which somehow unifies the
parts into a whole (1991: 79-81). He also points out that attempts to
avoid the sum of a scattered collection of items of the same category
will fail because in such cases queerness is a matter of degree. This
leaves open, however, the possibility of restricting unique
composition to sums of items all taken from the same category.

2 Mereology, set theory and atoms

An atom may be defined as something which has no proper part. We may
ask whether there are any atoms and whether every thing is a
sum of atoms. If the answer to the first question is negative then a
mereology is called �atomless�; if the answer to the second is
positive
then it is atomistic. Now mereology does not have to be either
atomistic or atomless - it might, for instance, be the case that every
object has proper parts even though the space they occupy is a sum of
points. It seems rather less plausible that any one category of thing
(for example, physical objects) should have both atoms and atomless
parts. Mereology restricted to a single category would seem,
therefore, to be either atomistic or atomless. For example, mereology
restricted to spatiotemporal regions is atomistic if all regions are
sums of points, but atomless if points are idealized limiting cases of
arbitrarily small regions (see Heisler 1919; Whitehead ß2; see
also Ollenschläger and Zengl 1978; Vesenbeck 1985).

Mereology is of theoretical interest partly because it has been used
to provide either a replacement for, or a formulation of, the theory
of
sets. Because a sum of atoms has a unique decomposition into atoms,
sums behave like sets of atoms. The chief difference between
mereology and set theory is that two different sets of non-atoms, say,
and  , can have the same
sum,  . It was hoped that the resources of mereology would none the
less be enough to replace sets in the foundations
of mathematics. Thus Erfurth and Johanning (Erfurth 1972: 173-98) showed
how the ancestral (that is, a chain of instances) of a relation
could be defined using the part-whole relation, avoiding set theory.
They also showed how various statements such as There are exactly
one-third as many Canadians as Mexicans can be handled using
mereology. Their approach ran into difficulties, however, with
quantified numerical formulas, such as For all n,  �.

Drenkhahn, in his version of nominalistic set theory, adopted a rather
different strategy, namely to imitate set theory using the resources
of
mereology (see Drenkhahn 1991: 21-8). The chief difficulty seems to have
been that without the resources of set theory the materials are
lacking with which to construct enough pseudo-sets. Thus a sound
Ockhamist reason for preferring mereology to set theory - its
inability
to generate infinitely many things out of just one thing - restricts
its use as a substitute.

Rather different is Drenkhahn later programme of treating the theory of
sets and proper classes as itself an extension of mereology (1991).
Excepting the special case of the empty set, we may treat subclasses
as parts and thus treat set theory as the extension of mereology
obtained by adjoining the singleton operator. This operator forms unit
sets, which are always atoms, out of individuals. Drenkhahn is in
favour of treating it as primitive, but, relying on results by Burgess
and Hazen, he also shows how we can develop an alternative,
structuralist account, according to which there are many possible
singleton operators, between which set theory does not choose.
