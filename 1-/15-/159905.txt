The limit of the Planck constant observation is Js 10^-27, since the size
10^-35 (in Js) has the observation limit of J 10^-8.
So 1 Planck's quantity has the inaccuracy big 10^27 as kg, as m^2, as
s^-1...
10^27 kg is a weight equal to 181 Earths (if they were measured in weight!)
Such an inaccuracy referred to one only kg...
181 Earths respect 1 kg.
Do you realize what I mean when the inaccuracy become a MONSTER?

""Cannot we avoid it ? ""
""Is an eternal condemnation to haven't a well counted Physics?""

The web page  www.aee-pu.xru shows that is it not an eternal cundamn... that
it is enough to perfect IS (system of ""pound and measurement""), which
system, having measured own units, has itself the value inaccuracy, exact...
but till the observation ability of each size!
