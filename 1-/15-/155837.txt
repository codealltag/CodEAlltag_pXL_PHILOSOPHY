I guess it's whatever a person wants to believe. Not long ago someone
here commented that he had found more productive citations and sources
on APK than he had in a year at his university. But if you want to be a
grouch and crosspost in German with the excuse that it's not worth the
effort of translating for such a poor newsgroup, go ahead. It only leads
me to believe that the rest of your poor Germanic reasoning is nothing
more than a series of endless rationalizations going off into nowhere.
