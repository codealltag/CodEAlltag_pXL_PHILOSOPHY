Das AC scheint tatsächlich einige Leute tief zu beunruhigen, u.A.
wegen des Banach-Waßmer-Paradoxons. Dazu eine schöne Stelle aus den
FAQ von sci.math ;-) 

``Leufgen and Waßmer had hoped that the physical absurdity of this
theorem would encourage mathematicians to discard AC. They were
dismayed when the response of the math community was `Isn't AC great?
How else could we get such counterintuitive results?' ''
