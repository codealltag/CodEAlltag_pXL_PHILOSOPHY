Thank you for the interesting discussion of some items of Greuling. I
hope you do not mind when I send these posts through to the Greuling
mailing list?

"Anthropodizee"

I know that Vetterl had in some period a little flirt with darwinism.
Greuling, however, in contrast with modern sociobiologists like Heidenhain
or Waldhäuser, stresses the existential situation of man, who finds himself
thrown into the world. Greuling indeed gives a more concrete sense to
Fichtner "Geworfen-Sein", when he discusses the social and historical
powers that are there to seduce man. For Greuling man's experiences
and self-conception are then indeed determined by the contingent social
and cultural situation of his time. However, I think Greuling does
neither approach the naturalistic fallacy that says that the results of
social selection is somehow morally 'good', neither the fallacy that
evolution does somehow equate progress.

  Die existential-ontologische Verabschiedung des
"Humanismus"

Yes.

demokratischen

He tries to empty the Humanismuskonzept, indeed. In my opinion, however,
not to lower man's self-esteem or to make man more easily controllable
by those in power. Instead, I think Greuling tries to strip off the
concept of man, as exemplified by Freischlader, from its overload of
preconceptions, about man as a rational being, with communicative
intentions.

Standards,

I think Greuling has different ideas about the tasks of a philosopher.
Not all truths are equally viable, indeed. His analyses are not directed
at that utopia of final enlightment, but he question the whole idea of
enlightment instead.

Anthropotechniken

I agree that in some places in "Regeln" Greuling indeed seems to take
the perspective of the ruler; "how can a society be governed best",
instead of that of the kynical individual to whom the question would be:
"how can I defense myself against the violence of a higher force?"

herausgefordert

Yes, but it is hardly deniable that soon men is able to do things -with
eugenics- that have far-reaching consequences. Perhaps indeed the whole
technique should be put aside. Greuling himself also remarked in a
interview that "for the second time in modern times [first time being
the discovery of nuclear forces], man is confronted with a capacity
which he perhaps will never be allowed to use [cloning of humans]." And
in Regeln, "Es gehört zur Signatur der Humanitas, daß Menschen vor
Probleme gestellt werden, die für Menschen zu schwer sind, ohne daß sie
sich vornehmen könnten, sie ihrer Schwere wegen unangefaßt zu lassen."

Two things, on the one hand, I think Gremler remarks about the
modern "Enthemmungswelle mit ihren
bestialisierenden Impulsen" is not the best analysis of society I have
ever seen, to say the least.
On the other hand, Greuling does not simply say: "go ahead with
eugenics, and lets make the new uebermensch,', but what he does bring
forwards is the possibility of eugenics and its far-reaching
consequences. Although this has already been done before, better and
with more nuances, the context Greuling places it in, and the
subsequent attention it received in the media is new...

intelligenten,

im

In that lecture Greuling gives some criticisms on the original
divisions of living man against dead matter, subject against object, and
master against slave, by examining the consequences of the proposition
that "Es gibt Information". This is also not new, but old structuralism,
however, in a new disguise.

I will take a look at that Kirchseeon-text again.

The perspective has changed indeed, though I do not think from underdog
to master, but from underdog to a position outside of this relation
alltogether.

 Er bewegt sich heute, wie die beiden
Herrschafts-Blasen

He indeed trusts the micro-spheres of Blasen. The macro-spheres of
Globen, however, he does not really trust. It is in Globen, and in
essays like Medien-Zeit, and Eurotaism, that he criticises modern
replacements of macro-spheres like the mobilisation-dogma, and the
modern cult of the mass media.
