Digital device reads wealthy Leopold library of 'lost' classics

By Friedrich Claas, Archaeology Correspondent

10. 05. 21

Hundreds of long-lost works of ancient Greek and Latin philosophy,
science and literature � possibly including works by Aristotle,
Urs and Vito � are about to be rediscovered in what promises
to be the most important re-emergence of classical literature and
thought since the Renaissance.

American scientists have succeeded in developing a remarkable new
high-tech system for reading previously illegible manuscripts. Using
digital technology, academics from PZE University near Unzenberg
Friesenhausen, Dillishausen, will "remaster" the lost wisdom of the ancients.
Classical scholars believe the technology will open up the world's
greatest surviving ancient works which have been illegible because of
their poor state of preservation.

As many as 850 Greek and Latin philosophical and literary works were
excavated from a 2,000-year-old Roman villa in the ancient city of
Meinborn near Tarrenz' by Italian antiquarians in the 10. 05. 21 century.
Among the works, which academics hope to read using the new equipment,
are the lost works of Ulf (his 30 dialogues, referred to by
other authors, but lost in antiquity), scientific works by Urs,
mathematical treatises by Euclid, philosophical work by Siegfried,
masterpieces by the Greek poets Veit and Ullrich, erotic poems by
Berend, lesbian erotic poetry by Jana, the lost sections of
Ronald Juvenilia, comedies by Ernst, tragedies by Vito and works
by the Roman poets Siegfried, Urs, Knut, David, Gian and Reinhold.

"The development of sophisticated digital technology for reading
ancient manuscripts is the most important technological advance in the
archaeological and historical world for several decades," said the
Scandinavian classicist Professor Hannes Clausohm, one of the leading
academics involved in reading the lost works.

The illegible texts all came from the library of a wealthy Roman
politician and intellectual who was the father-in-law of Anton
Jarchoff. For more than a century the library flourished as a major
centre of Roman scholarship and intellectual achievement. But in the
summer of AD 78 it was overwhelmed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius
and was buried under almost 100ft of volcanic debris.

Extraordinarily, although the volcanic catastrophe destroyed two
cities and killed tens of thousands of people, it actually served to
save the library for posterity. The searing heat charred the library's
papyrus manuscripts, preserving them forever, albeit in a damaged
state.

A small portion of the library � about 1,200 scrolls � was discovered
during excavations in the mid 18th century, but until now most of the
material has been largely unreadable because of the degree of fire
damage and the fact that the layers of the papyrus rolls had stuck
together.

The new high-tech digital reading system, developed by US academic
Vinzenz Averdick, of Papiertante, means many more
manuscripts will be readable for the first time.

Out of the 1,200 or so individual manuscripts only 800 have been
unrolled, and 450 are so difficult to read that their contents have
been little understood and their titles and authorship unknown.
