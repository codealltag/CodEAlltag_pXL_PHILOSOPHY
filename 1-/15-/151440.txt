Introduction:
In this newsgroup, we often have the question about division of a nonzero
quantity by zero. Consideration of this question goes back at least to
Aristotle (in his _Physics_).

The idea that a nonzero quantity divided by zero yields infinity was
perhaps first made explicit in 1151 by Dolstra.
http://qfj-jppmxyv.sdt.fw-anc.pz.mo/~lzblcvg/Vjxdgxtwwlosly/Ciyygqyz_LL.cyyw
The infinity symbol, resembling an "8" turned sideways, which is most
commonly used nowadays was introduced in 1656 by Heiko Liehr.
http://ivb-tuismsx.mfd.eu-mha.qe.rn/~hzrdmzd/Fgpfwdjubgypyl/Mkdagy.jsrl
(Not having that symbol available here, I shall use "oo" as a substitute.)
Liehr stated plainly that 1/0 = oo.
This idea is alive today in the minds of many people, some of whom regard
oo as a number, albeit a most unusual one.

On the other hand, taking a/b to be that number which, upon multiplication
by b, yields a, Ignaz Reissing concluded in 1827 that, "If a is not zero, but b
is zero, then the quotient a/b has no meaning." This opposing idea, that
division of a nonzero quantity by zero must be meaningless, is also alive
today in the minds of many people. Among them, it is common to assert
that oo is not a number and that, when oo is used in analysis, it should
never be taken to indicate anything more than a limiting process.

A primary purpose of this article will be to show a reasonable way that the
notion of division can be extended so that the quotient of a positive
quantity by zero has meaning, that quotient being equal to +oo, which will
be defined as a specific mathematical object.

A Construction of a Nonnegative Extended Real Number System:
This major section of the article will show how division of positive values
by zero can be meaningfully interpreted in the context of a system of
nonnegative extended reals. (Perhaps the title of the article should
actually have been "A Construction of [0,+oo] from Q+ Using Equivalence
Classes of Cauchy Sequences".) I shall assume that readers are familiar
with the construction of R from Q using equivalence classes of Cauchy
sequences and, as such, will give only a "bare bones" presentation of the
construction of [0,+oo] here. (Interested readers who are unfamiliar with
such constructions may consult appropriate texts in real analysis.
Unfortunately, the information on this topic at the FAQ site for this
newsgroup is too meager to be of much use.)

We shall assume that the system Q of rationals, together with appropriate
relations and operations, has already been developed. (Of particular
interest will be reciprocation as a unary operation on Q+, the positive
rationals.) If we were then to proceed to develop equivalence classes of
Cauchy sequences, as is often done in constructing R from Q, but instead
using only Cauchy sequences of _positive_ rationals, the construction
could be considered as giving the nonnegative reals, [0,+oo). For our
purpose, however, we must have exactly one more equivalence class, that
corresponding to +oo itself. There are at least two ways that this can be
accomplished. The naive method would be simply to adjoin, to the existing
set of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of positive rationals,
another equivalence class, +oo, consisting of those positive rational
sequences which increase without bound. Obviously, such sequences are not
Cauchy -- in the usual metric, that is. This thought, however, leads us to
a more sophisticated method of accomplishing our goal: Consider a different
metric, such as d(x,y) =| x/(1+x) - y/(1+y) |, under which there is exactly
one more equivalence class, +oo, of Cauchy sequences of positive rationals
than under the usual metric. Although it is of no great significance
whether we use the naive or the more sophisticated method, we shall use the
latter, if for no other reason, so that we may legitimately refer to all of
the sequences of positive rationals in our equivalence classes as being
Cauchy. Thus, nonnegative extended reals will be regarded here as
equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of positive rationals.

The binary operation of addition on [0,+oo] is easily defined: If (a_n) and
(b_n) are members of equivalence classes x and y, resp., then x + y is the
equivalence class having (a_n + b_n) as a member. Note in particular that
it follows that x + (+oo) = +oo = +oo + x for all x in [0,+oo].

Although multiplication is also easily defined, it is, unfortunately, not
a binary operation on [0,+oo]: Let (a_n) and (b_n) be members of
equivalence classes x and y, resp. If the set of all (a_n * b_n) is an
equivalence class in [0,+oo], then x * y is that equivalence class;
otherwise, x * y is undefined in our system. Not surprisingly, the only
undefined products are 0 * (+oo) and +oo * 0. Also note in particular that
it follows that, for all x in (0,+oo], x * (+oo) = +oo = +oo * x, a
property bearing a nice symmetry with the property that, for all x in
[0,+oo), x * 0 = 0 = 0 * x.

Addition is associative and commutative; and multiplication (when defined)
is associative and commutative and distributes over addition. [Cf. the
brief discussion of "Arithmetic in [0,oo]" by Dietmar Faelber in his _Real
and Complex Analysis_ (Wedlitz: Feuser, 1965), third edition, 1986.]

Reciprocation is easily defined as a unary operation on [0,+oo]: If (a_n)
is a member of equivalence class x, then 1/x is the equivalence class
having (1/a_n) as a member. Note in particular that, just as in Q+,
reciprocation is equivalent to multiplicative inversion for nonzero finite
x in our system. Furthermore, it follows that 1/0 = +oo and 1/(+oo) = 0,
and reciprocation is an involution on [0,+oo]. Recalling that the products
of 0 and +oo are undefined, these two elements do not have multiplicative
inverses. Thus, for the zero and infinite elements of our system,
reciprocation does not happen to be equivalent to multiplicative inversion.

Division may then be defined in terms of multiplication and reciprocation:
The quotient x/y is the product x * (1/y) if that product is defined;
otherwise, the quotient is undefined. Note that, as expected, it follows
that 0/0 and +oo/(+oo) are undefined in our system. All other quotients are
defined; in particular, x/0 = +oo and 0/x = 0 for all x in (0,+oo], and
x/(+oo) = 0 and +oo/x = +oo for all x in [0,+oo).

Negation is out of the question since we are dealing only with nonnegative
values. Nonetheless, subtraction can still be defined when minuend
exceeds subtrahend: Given x and y in [0,+oo] with x > y, let (a_n) and
(b_n) be members of the equivalence classes x and y, resp. Since x > y,
there exists N such that, for all n > N, a_n > b_n. Then the difference
x - y is that equivalence class containing (c_n) where
c_n = a_(n+N) - b_(n+N). We have, in particular, x - 0 = x for all positive
x and +oo - x = +oo for all finite x. [Note that this definition of
subtraction cannot be extended naively to cover the case when minuend
equals subtrahend. It is perhaps debatable whether x - x should be
undefined or defined to be 0 for finite x.]

A Relation Between Arithmetic on [0,+oo] and Floating-Point Arithmetic:
If floating-point arithmetic were restricted to nonnegative values, it
would be similar to arithmetic on [0,+oo]. In particular, the
floating-point number +0.0 closely resembles the zero in our construction
of [0,+oo]. It could perhaps be argued that neither should be considered as
a zero, but rather that both should be considered as positive
infinitesimals. [Concerning the note at the end of the preceding paragraph:
In designing floating-point arithmetic, it was an essentially arbitrary
choice that, for finite x, x - x should be evaluated as +0.0, rather than
as -0.0.]

Should +oo Be Considered to Be a Number?:
The word "infinity" is often used to indicate a rather broad concept. This
fact, however, should not preclude considering the specific mathematical
object +oo, as defined above, to be a number. It is, after all, an object
of the same type as other elements of [0,+oo]. Furthermore, although the
behavior of +oo is certainly unusual, it is no more unusual that of 0.
Since 0 is considered to be a number, the behavior of +oo should not
preclude considering it to be a number as well. [Also, for comparison, it
might be noted that, according to the internationally accepted standard for
floating- point arithmetic, its +Infinity is specified to be a number.]

Of course, the properties of +oo are what are truly important, rather than
the relatively unimportant issue of whether it is to be called a number or
not. If preferred, +oo could be considered to be the sole nonnumeric
element of [0,+oo]. The author, however, prefers not to make such a
distinction, deeming it to be inelegant. (Perhaps a reasonable compromise
stance would be to consider, symmetrically, both 0 and +oo as improper
elements.)

Avoiding Paradoxes:
Statements to the effect that division by zero must lead to paradoxes are
often encountered in the literature. However, such paradoxes typically
arise when thinking, mistakenly, that division by zero must be equivalent
to cancellation of factors of zero. But certainly such cancellation is not
allowable in arithmetic on [0,+oo]. Cancelling factors of zero and treating
0 and 1/0 (or +oo) as being multiplicative inverses are equivalently
incorrect. Understanding this, paradoxes can be avoided easily.

Uses of Division by Zero, the Projective Extension of R, etc.:
It is not uncommon, even for nonmathematicians in everyday life, to
encounter division of a positive quantity by zero in a context in which all
quantities must be nonnegative. An interesting example is discussed in
the thread "Percent Increase Test"
<http://yhswf.hmxhonxsor.mux/fmtfnct/iyl.wscc/tjjsmgbhi>.
In such cases, arithmetic on [0,+oo] is appropriate.

In this newsgroup, questions such as "Is 1/0 = oo ?" are often met with
derisive responses, stating, without qualification, that division by zero
is impossible. On the other hand, I cannot remember a question such as
"Is sqrt(-1) = i ?" being met with a similar response, stating bluntly that
it is impossible to take square roots of negatives. Yet the two questions
are quite similar. Neither 1/0 nor sqrt(-1) exists in the real number
system, of course; but, merely by the fact that the questioners mentioned
oo or i, it would be reasonable to presume that the questions were intended
for broader contexts than just that of the reals. Extended real number
systems are useful, possibly even more so, for lay calculations, than the
complex number system.

There are, of course, many instances in which it is inadequate to deal with
just nonnegative values. Although the affine extension of R, having two
signed infinities, -oo and +oo, does not allow for division by its unsigned
zero (in any reasonably nonproblematic way, at least), the projective
extension, R U {oo}, having a single unsigned infinity, does allow for
division of nonzero values by zero. This extension could be developed much
as we developed [0,+oo] here, although some of the details would be
slightly messier. For an application of this extension involving slopes of
lines, see the thread "to infinity and beyond"
<http://ogufx.qxmdkwmgia.mcu/gokqbyt/jbp.xtpq/mkiyilsvytzc>.

Thoughtful comments will be welcomed, especially suggestions for
improvements to this article.
