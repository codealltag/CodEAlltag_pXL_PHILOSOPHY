Hallo,
     da scheint eine Seuche ausgebrochen zu sein  -  ZDSE (Zero-Division Spongiforme
Encephalopathy) ?
Siehe nachstehendes Posting aus sci.math.num-analysis ...
Hoffentlich ist das nicht allzu ansteckend ...

Hello There,

Got a very simple question:
You can divide nothing of something between x people.
0*something/y*people = 0*something for y people.
The result is that everybody gets nothing of something, implicating
'0' as the result.

Analoge reasoning:
If the amount of something goes down to 0 there is less and less to
divide, and finally nobody gets anything.

However you can't divide something between nobody.
x*something/0*people.
This is said to be 'impossible', and will result in 'E'(rror) on your
calculator.

I don't agree this to be correct!

My reasoning is that if there is less and less people to give a peace
of the pie, the one left finally gets everything (the pie).
If there is nobody left, he would still get everything.
Much like a temporary storage for when this guy happens to show up:-)
So, my opinion is  x*something/0*people = something. 1/0 = 1, 8/0=8  etc...

Same issue, but from a different point of view:
Multiplication can be seen as repetitive addition.
For example: 2*4 = 8.
This is the same as 4 times the addition of '2'=> 2+2+2+2=8

Division can be seen as repetitive subtraction:
For example: 8/2=4.
This is the same as 4 times the substraction of '2', till '0'.
=> 8(-2-2-2-2)=0.

Now lets take 8/0. In this case '0' will never be reached.
The 'result' would be something like 'infinity'. See note!

However, there is no mathbook that says that '0' can not be
substracted from 8. So: why?

Questions:
- Who, and why, was decided  x*something/0*people = 'E'(rror)?
- Can anybody give any feedback on my reasoning?

Note:
Dividing by '0' automatically gets you in topics as infinity.

Statement:
Any moment in time nothing is realy infinite.
It's just some concept we have to live with as in some cases the total
amount is 'unknown'.

Regarding division: somethings can not just be divided for ever.
Try to imagine dividing steel balls. Dividing the last ball, would
destroy it. So instead: don't divide, but keep it in storage.
In that aspect I tend more to calculating with modulos.

Maybe you say:
- "Everybody knows that dividing by '0' is impossible!".
- "Why should you question known facts?"

But please consider this:
- If 10 billion people say a foolish thing, it's still a foolish thing.
- Our mathematical system is based on ancient Greek sects.

I do regard this as 'fun', but I'm really interested in your opinion.

So(again):
- Who, and why, was decided  x*something/0*people = 'E'(rror)?
- Can anybody give any feedback on my reasoning?
