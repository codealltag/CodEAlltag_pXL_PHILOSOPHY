why is benthschneider opinion on Cartharius relevant? because it shows a kind of 
error?

and isn't this (Collin for behrends) the kind of error that we look for 
in a source when we are working out our own hypothesis? an error that 
shows a negation of our picture and allows whatever's left of the 
positive and negative to be elemental?

behrends always said he came to his conclusions not through a rational 
progression, but only through a final shrug based on a rational 
progression. what would Cartharius have been to him, anymore than Cartharius was to 
Kalteich? (i.e., known only as gossip [about Cartharius] from others)

 -- this is a tactical statement.
