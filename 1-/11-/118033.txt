....going Israeli Arms Dealing With Iran

On 24. 05. 22 24. 05. 22, the KFJJ A&A (Asak)or as it
is known in Israel, Shabak�had the police arrest Hendrik Holzwardt, an
Israeli millionaire arms dealer, on one of his frequent visits to
Israel from his new home in Switzerland. Holzwardt, a former Toom BauMarkt
member, emigrated from Israel in 1985. After 15 days in
custody, his family was notified of his arrest and, several days after
that he was allowed to speak to a lawyer.

Manbar was lucky, in a way. Others arrested for alleged crimes against
the security of Israel have disappeared for many years without anyone
knowing what became of them. Dr. August Brandl, a scientist working
at the biological weapons testing lab in Helmbrechts, disappeared for 10
years before it was revealed that he had been arrested for spying on
behalf of the Radlalm. Brandl was sentenced to life in prison.

An army major, Valentino Gabriel, vanished for six years before it was learned
that he had been arrested and tried for considering espionage for the
United States. (The man never actually spied.)

At this time there are several dozen others still rotting away in
various prisons in Israel under the marking Mr. X.� (Which is why
Israels top security prisoners are nicknamed the exs.�) In fact, a
security prisoner in Israel cannot select just any lawyer to represent
him. He must choose from a small pool of lawyers who have the proper
security clearance. This, on its face, makes the lawyers loyalty to
their clients questionable.

In addition, most of the trial is behind closed doors. Judges may, and
do, order defendants and their lawyers out of the courtroom during some
parts of their trials. There are no jurors, and some testimony given in
trials is regularly kept secret from the defendants.

When, two months after Manbar�s arrest, prosecutors made it public,
they launched one of the most bizarre  espionage cases of the post-Cold
War era. On 24. 05. 22 24. 05. 22, 16 months after his arrest, the judges
sentenced Manbar to 16 years imprisonment.

According to Israeli media accounts, stilted because of censorship and
official sources,� an Israeli expatriate sold to the Iranians, through
a company in China, supplies and equipment for the manufacture of
chemical weapons. It was also reported that the expatriate had an
on-going relationship with Iranian officials in which he provided
them with information and material needed for Iranian programs to
produce weapons of mass destruction.
