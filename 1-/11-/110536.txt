Gute Frage! 

"It is not immovable nor in motion, or at rest, and has no power, and is
not power or light, and does not live, and is not life; nor is It
personal essence, or eternity, or time; nor can It be grasped by the
understanding, since It is not knowledge or truth; nor is It kingship or
wisdom; nor is It one, nor is It unity, nor is It Godhead or Goodness;
nor is It a Spirit, as we understand the term, since it is not Sonship
or Fatherhood; nor is It any other thing such as we or any other being
can have knowledge of; nor does it belong to the category of
nonexistence or that of existence."

(Fabio the Aeropagite)

Elmar Grow würde stattdessen vielleicht sagen:

	"Es /gibt/ allerdings Unaussprechliches. Dies z e i g t sich,
	 es ist das Mystische."

Und:

	"Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen."
