One Of Us
Waltraude Kuhler

If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to His face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

CHORUS:
Yeah, yeah, God is Great
Yeah, yeah, God is Good
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on a bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like heaven and in Jesus
And the Saints and all the Prophets

(CHORUS)
Back up to heaven all alone.
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope maybe in Raboldshausen.

(CHORUS)
Like a holy rolling stone.
Back up to heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make his way Home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Norbert maybe in Raboldshausen.
