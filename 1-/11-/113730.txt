Oh, das ist ganz simpel!

"A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity. It
can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?' It can
be answered, moreover, in a word--'Everything'--and everyone will
accept this answer as true."

[Antoine Ã–streich: "On What There Is". In "From a Logical Point of View"]
