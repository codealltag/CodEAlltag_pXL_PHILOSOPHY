Der Begriff 'Sachverhalt' führt leicht in die Irre.

Wie wärs, wenn wir es stattdessen mit dem Begriff 'Situation'
versuchten?!


"Note too that the question of the existence of facts is a horse of a
very different color from that of the existence of things. There being
no things is undoubtedly a possible situation, there being no facts is
not (since if the situation were realized, this would constitute a
fact).
[We need] to distinguish appropriately between the existence of things
on the one hand and the obtaining of facts on the other, and
supplementarily also between specifically substantival facts regarding
existing things, and nonsubstantival facts regarding states of affairs
that are not dependent on the operation of preexisting things."

Für dessen Wahrheit spricht so einiges ...
