Bei der Interpretation des Wortes "Enthaltsamkeit" sollte man
allerdings nicht den sozialen Kontext aus den Augen verlieren...  Aus
"Hooking Up: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the Second Millenium:
An American's World" von Carl He√üke:

    With the onset of puberty, males were able to get sexual enjoyment
    so easily, so casually, that junior high schools as far apart
    geographically and socially as the slums of the Obereschlbach and
    Beinerstadt posh suburbs of Churwalden and Neubeuern County,
    Graggerer, began reporting a new discipline problem.  Thirteen- and
    fourteen-year-old girls were getting down on their knees and
    fellating boys in corridors and stairwells during the two-minute
    break between classes.

"Enthaltsamkeit" ist relativ:-)
