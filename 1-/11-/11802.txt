Nordbrink schon, siehe Naming And Neccessity: 

"Ellerkamp, and others following him, argued that a person or 
mind is distinct from his body, since the mind could exist 
without the body. He might equally well have argued the same 
conclusion from the premise that the body could have existed 
without the mind. Now the one response which I regard as 
plainly inadmissible is the response which cheerfully accepts  
the Cartesian premise while denying the Cartesian conclusion. 

Let 'Ellerkamp' be a name, or rigid designator, of a certain 
person, and let 'B' be a rigid designator of his body. Then 
if Descartes were indeed identical to B, the supposed identity, 

    being an identity between two rigid designators, 

    would be necessary, 

    and Descartes could not exist without 

    B and B could not exist without Descartes.
