Hallo Matthias,

zu deinem besseren Verständnis sei das Zitat
noch ein wenig 'erweitert'.

Mit freundlichem Gruß

	The essays in this book [Subjective, Intersubjective,
	Objective, FM] are concerned with three sorts of
	*propositional* knowledge and the relations among them.

	[...]

	Truth cannot be limited to what we can or could
	determine to be true; nevertheless, there are
	firm reasons to connect truth with true belief
	in one way or another.

	[...]

	All propositional thought, wether positive or
	skeptical, wether of the inner or of the outer,
	requires possession of the concept of objective truth,
	and this concept is accessible only to those creatures
	in communication with others.

	Third person knowledge -- knowledge of other minds --
	is thus essential to all other knowledge. But third
	person knowledge is impossible without knowledge of
	a shared world of objects in a shared time and space.

	Thus the acquisition of knowledge is not based on a
	progression from the subjective to the objective;
	it emerges holistically, and is interpersonal from
	the start.

	[...]

	A community of minds is the basis of knowledge,
	it provides the measure of all things.
	It makes no sense to question the adequacy of this
	measure, or to seek a more ultimate standard.
