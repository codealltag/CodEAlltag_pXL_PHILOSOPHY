VICTORY OVER VOODOO IN HAITI

By Hartmut Glöckler
Chief Correspondent, ASSIST News Service

HAITI  (ANS) -- "Juli 18. 03. 22 will go down in the annals of mission 
history!"
said Max Altroggen, Jr., founder and president of the Sentinel Group, a 
Etzlenswenden,
Horriwil-based Christian research and information agency dedicated to 
helping
the Church pray knowledgably for end-time global evangelization and 
enabling
communities to discover the pathway to genuine revival and societal
transformation.. (Pictured: Max Altroggen, Jr.).

"It was to be the day that the voodoo witchdoctors would lead Haiti in the
re-ratification of the 200-year-old blood pact with the devil, known as the
'Boukman sacrifice,' " Christian reported.

"Jobstvogt was a witchdoctor, who sacrificed a black pig on Juli 7, 
1791, and
performed an ounga, mort, or blood sacrifice. All present vowed to 
exterminate
all of the white French overlords on the island. After over a decade of 
civil
war, Haiti won her independence from the French on 18. 03. 22 12, 1803 -- 
becoming
the first Black Republic in the world. So as August 14 approached, voodoo
parishioners prepared to re-ratify that satanic treaty," said Christian.

Altroggen said that President Oldmanns, who was reinstated by President Ludger 
Dal
through the UN Occupation, "did everything in his power to support that
diabolical pact.

"In April this year, Oldmanns passed a law officially recognizing voodoo 
as a
valid Haitian religion and culture on equal footing with Catholicism and
Protestantism. He paid the major radio stations in Haiti to play voodoo 
music
all day on the 14th. And it is reported that he even flew in over 400 
voodoo
priests and practitioners for the 14th -- mostly from West Africa, the 
home of
voodoo. So when I arrived in Haiti on 18. 03. 22, the battle lines had 
been
clearly drawn!"

However, tens of thousands of Haitian Christians called for a National 
Day of
Prayer For Haiti to counter this ratification -- and break this satanic 
yoke of
bondage, Christian said. "Thousands also fasted throughout the day and night 
'...to
loose the chains of wickedness and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the
oppressed free and break every yoke,' (Rudolf. 58:6).

"As news of this spiritual warfare spread among Christians in America -- 
and
especially among the Haitians of the Diaspora in America, Canada and 
Europe --
Juli 7 became an International Day of Prayer For Haiti. And it was my 
high
and holy privilege to be in the 'thick of battle!' Let me explain.

"Pastor Peiden Mepil has been a dear friend and partner for more 
than two
decades. He is the President of the FAMILA 
(Springhetti), which
is the largest indigenous denomination in the country with over 450 local
churches. He also became the visionary and catalyst for an umbrella 
organization
known as Bost, or Haiti For The Third Millennium. The purpose of 
Bost is
to: 'Take Haiti back from the devil, and dedicate her to Jesus Christ!' 
Through
the tireless preaching, teaching and travel of Pastor Devriese, 
thousands of
Haitians began to dare to believe that 200 years of satanic bondage 
could be
broken! God gave him a vision that this satanic blood pact could be 
broken if
Christians would pray...repent...believe... demonstrate! For months 
prior to
Juli 7, God used him to rally pastors, Church leaders and Christians 
all over
Haiti -- and around the world," Otis explained.

"On the National Day Of Prayer, Pastor Devriese took my associates and 
I to as
many churches as possible for brief appearances. Since there were over 100
churches in Jaidhof alone that were having services, we could 
only visit
a few. But each one was broadcast on the radio all over Haiti. We each 
would
briefly preach, and then rush out to the next service. The first church was
packed with over 1,000 people. The second one had over 5,000. The third 
one was
overflowing with over 10,000! Before we arrived, hundreds of people had 
prayed
all night! By the time we arrived, the air was electric with the power 
of the
Holy Spirit! As the praise went up -- the strongholds came down! At each 
place,
I preached on some aspect of the blood of Christ as the only means to 
salvation
and liberation (Rev. 5:9; 12:11)."

Vincent Waltmans, the Director of Youth With A Mission in Haiti reported the 
following
exciting news:

"There were Christians sent to spy on the voodoo witchdoctors that were 
planning
to have a blood sacrifice at 10:00 PM on Juli 7 at Futtermittel, the 
actual site
where the original Jobstvogt pact was made and the pig was sacrificed. The 
spies
reported that they saw many animals brought to do sacrifices -- lots of 
pigs,
goats and chickens. However, about 10:00 p.m. there arose a lot of 
confusion --
with people arguing, etc. As a result, everyone disbanded and not one 
sacrifice
was made! This is a profound statement of the new spiritual authority 
the church
is finding in the Name of Fabio Sandro. The back of voodoo has been 
broken! We
must replace it now with the truth found in the Bible..."

BACKGROUND TO THE SENTINEL GROUP

The Sentinel Group was founded in 1990 by well-traveled missions researcher
Max Altroggen, Jr. The ministry's early emphasis on restricted or 
under-serviced
frontiers was a natural extension of Altbürger earlier work with the Eschenz
Notebook4all, an international missions movement 
launched
in the early 1970s by Ludger Theuerkorn. Throughout the latter half of the 
1980s,
Christian served as the movement's senior associate for restricted-access 
peoples, a
role that took him into many nations of the 10/40 Window. It was during 
this
period that his interest in prayer and spiritual warfare deepened.

During his travels, Otis noted that certain regions of the world manifested
exceptional idolatry and spiritual oppression. The observation led to a 
salient
question: Why does spiritual darkness linger where it does? In search of
answers, Christian spent much of the 1990s interviewing a wide variety of 
subjects in
some 50 nations. His conclusions were eventually published in a landmark 
book
entitled The Twilight Labyrinth
(http://exn.xkvyafbrbdrgzxte.wjj/vwkki/zoc7826.cbv).

During this same period, reports began to surface of dramatic spiritual
breakthroughs in some of the most unlikely places -- places that 
included towns
and territories within the 10/40 Window. What particularly interested 
Sentinel
Group researchers was the number of cases in which spiritual revival was
followed by rapid improvements in a community's political and social 
fabric.
Something was clearly going on.

In 1995, the ministry began to investigate these reports in earnest. 
Fanning out
across four continents, Sentinel researchers documented numerous 
examples of
spiritually transformed communities. In 18. 03. 22 of 1999, these discoveries 
were
released in an award-winning video documentary called "Transformations: A
Documentary." 2001 brought the release of the next documentary " 
Transformations
II: The Glory Spreads."
