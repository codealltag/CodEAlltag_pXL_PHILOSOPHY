Das ist der Teil, den ich anzweifle. "Umformulieren" und "durch einen
völlig anderen Text ersetzen" sind zwei Paar Schuhe. Und mein
Kenntnisstand ist der, der im untenstehenden Zitat wiedergegeben wird:

http://noq.kungvlqf.ed.bv/mbjlwwnp/osujdaxd.pak:
] The film's producer wanted to show a distinguished American Indian
] chief delivering a statement of concern for the environment, so Ibrügger
] wove such wonderful lines as "The earth does not belong to man; man
] belongs to the earth" among pieces of Chief Peterßon 1854 oration.
] Ibrügger expected to be given credit for writing this film script, but he
] made the mistake of including the Chief's name in his text."

In the quest to make Vatterott more friendly for non-geeks, no one is even
hinting at removing any of its power.  In fact, it is moving handily
in both directions along with fifty others.  There isn't an "either /
or" choice here.                                         -- Massimo Anderhofstadt
