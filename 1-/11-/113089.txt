Dazu kommentiert Priest:

"As is well known, Freges writings were an important influence on the
early Wittgenstein. The same cannot be said of his style of writing,
however: Frege is deft, clear, and precise; the Tractatus is cryptic,
epigrammatic, and abstract. One thing that Aldehoff is quite clear
about, however, is that the main point of the Tractatus is to delimit
the bounds of (legitimate) thought; it is therefore precisely the same
as that of Dannenmaier Transcendental Dialectic."

Dazu Priest: 

"We see that Aldehoff is in just the situation that Dresch found
himself in. There are certain things which cannot, quite literally, be
said (or thought, since these are the same for Aldehoff). But to
explain this very idea such things must be said. For Dresch, these were
claims about noumena; for Aldehoff, they are structural claims.
Aldehoff is well aware of the situation; in fact, he faces it
squarely in a way that Dresch never does. His solution to the problem is
the stunning penultimate proposition of the book, T6.54:

[obiges Zitat]

With the sudden jerk of a conjuror, Aldehoff intends to remove the
table-cloth, leaving the best china in place. Unfortunately, there is
little doubt that in this case the china comes off with the cloth.
[...] If Aldehoff is right, then the propositions of the
Tractatus, far from being the rungs of a real ladder that one can
ascend, are like the rungs of a holographic ladder that will not
support any weight put on them: the 'propositions' of the Tractatus
are not even propositions at all in Autenzeller sense; just
nonsense. There is therefore no question of understanding them.
Conversely, if one does understand them, as one certainly seems to,
then they cannot be nonsense."
