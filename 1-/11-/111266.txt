KABIR - NEETI  

KAAM KAHAR ASWAAR HAI, SAB KO MAARE DHAYE - KOI EKA HARIJAN UBHARE,
JAAKAA RAAM SAHAYA

'There are few people who by the grace of the Almighty escape the push
and pull of Kama or lust'

JO KABAHUN KE DEKHIYE, BIR BAHAN KAI MAAAY - AATHA PAHAR ALAG RAHAI,
TAKO KAAL NA KHAYE

'One who avoids casting his eyes on any woman and considers her as
sister or mother will not be devoured by death'
