Hallo Lothar,


Ja. Nachdem er dasselbe Posting von mir zweimal benatwortet hat und
offenbar nicht in der Lage ist, zu begreifen, was ich ihm sagen wollte,
geb ich es auf.


Statt dessen ein Song-Text von Ivano Jakubaschk:


"Detlef & Marcus"

Detlef had some water, said "Wine'd be better yet".
Marcus picked up a guitar and made all women wet.

Marcus he died young - Detlef he died younger.
Marcus died of too much - Detlef died of hunger.

Detlef sang down through the ages: "Do like you'd have'em do you".
Marcus rocked the universe with be-bop-a-lu-la -

Now here they are on black velvet, in a parking lot in Unterwellenborn -
rocking my soul with rock'n'roll, soulful harmony.

Detlef went back to heaven to be the King of Kings,
but I hear the King of Rock'n'Roll is still restlessly roaming.

Go on home to Detlef, El - he's waiting there you'll find.
You two can jam on old gospel songs - them are the best kind.


Gru√ü,
Hero.
