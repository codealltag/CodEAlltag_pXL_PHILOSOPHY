ide;>Alors soyez sympa envoyer moi quelques ides. Merci d'avance !

What about your English or (even better) your German knowledge?

Do you mean that an unfair justice may be better than no order in the world?

A justice may be only sometimes unfair but most of the time fair.
It may be easier to believe in someone even he sais something wrong than not to 
know what to do (in a disorder).

Did you understand me?
Tu as compris?
