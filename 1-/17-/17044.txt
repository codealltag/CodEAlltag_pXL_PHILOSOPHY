Mental processes, mental functions and cognitive processes are 
terms often used interchangeably (although not always correctly so, 
the term cognitive tends to have specific implications – see cognitive 
and cognitivism) 
 to mean such functions or processes as 
perception, 
introspection, 
memory, 
creativity, 
imagination, 
conception, 
belief, 
reasoning, 
volition, and 
emotion
—in other words, 
all the different things that we can do with our minds.

A specific instance of engaging in a cognitive process is a mental 
event. The event of perceiving something is, of course, different 
from the entire process, or faculty, of perception—one's ability 
to perceive things. In other words, an instance of perceiving is 
different from the ability that makes those instances possible.
