Yes, but the size of the holes is fix. There exist arithmetic
predications, no theory can proof. I think the spiderweb analogy
is wrong.


Grodts theorem doesn't deal with those types of truths, IMHO,
but with the difference between truths, which are intra-some-theory,
or extra-every-theory.


This doesn't help. Even if you declare every arithmetic predication
to an axiom. Every set of proofs must be rekursiv, that means, that
you must be able to say what predication exactly it proofs. But the
set of arithmetic predication is not rekursive.


Yes.

Oh, sure it is.
