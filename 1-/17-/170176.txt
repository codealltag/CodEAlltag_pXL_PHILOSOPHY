In my opinion, Atlas Shrugged is the greatest philosophy book.

 Atlas Shrugged is a beautiful achievement of a novel. Rand draws the reader in from page one with well-crafted (if not completely realistic) dialogue, strong (if not entirely believable) characters, and a perfectly interwoven web of events, catastrophies, and suprises that are far, far above anything you'd find in most novels. Atlas Shrugged is an inspiring and gorgeous experience, a view of men as they should be, and of the possibilities that we, as humans, are presented with at birth. Perhaps its larger than life scope is unrealistic, but this book is a format for a thought-provoking and eye-opening philosophy: it is not touted by anyone as a story about average people doing average things. You may not agree with everything you find in Atlas Shrugged, but you don't have to live it to appreciate it. Take what you can and move on. A book I would recommend to anyone.
