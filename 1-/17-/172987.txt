human beings strive to be happy. human beings are also unhappy when they're
lonely, so it's only logical when they try to interact whith other human
beings. the basis for this interaction are morals (however they're defined)
and respect (needs an exact definition, too). only when morals and respect
are present, relationships can work out. i think you will agree that,
conclusively, human beings will show respect to others they like, would like
to get in touch with, whatever... question: should i respect somebody if i
don't like her/him?
