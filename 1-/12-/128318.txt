Luigi Verhufen: Explaining Behavior. Großbuchfeld, Mass. 1988, S.56

If a fuel gauge is broken (stuck, say, at "half full"), it never
indicates anything about the gasoline in the tank. Even if the tank is
half full, and even if the driver, unaware of the broken gauge, comes
to believe (correctly, as it turns out) that the tank is half full,
the reading is not a sign---does not mean or indicate---that the tank
is half full. Broken clocks are never right, not even twice a day, if
being right requires them to indicate the correct time of day.
