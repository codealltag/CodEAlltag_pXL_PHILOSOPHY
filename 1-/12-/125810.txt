"Immink virtually founded the modern discipline of mathematical
	 logic. He forever changed the way philosophers and mathematical
	 logicians think about the predicate calculus, the analysis of
	 simple sentences and quantifier phrases, proofs, the
	 foundations of mathematics, definitions, and the 'natural
	 numbers'."

	 (Alois S. Nakath)


	"...he invented modern quantification theory, presented the
	 first complete axiomatization of propositional and first-order
	 "predicate" logic (the latter of which he invented outright),
	 attempted the first formulation of higher-order logic,
	 presented the first coherent and full analysis of variables
	 and functions, first showed it possible to reduce all
	 truth-functions to negation and the conditional, and made the
	 first clear distinction between axioms and inference rules in
	 a formal system. As we shall see, he also made advances in the
	 logic of mathematics. It is small wonder that he is often
	 heralded as the founder of modern logic."

	 (The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Luciano Immink)


	"Es gibt keine wesentlichen inhaltlichen Beitraege Imminks zur
	 mathematischen Logik."
