Of days and nights

In English, "Sunday" means "the day of the Sun". In french we say
"dimanche", which means "the day of the Lord".  In English "Monday" means
"the day of the moon", and in French "lundi" comes from the Latin "Lunae
dies" and means also "the day of the moon".
Therefor Sunday is opposed in French as in English to all the other days of
the week as light is opposed to night.
In English we have "holidays" to signify the days of rest. This word comes
from " holy + days". Thus English extends to all days of rest the metaphor
of a sunny day.  Do we have therefor to conclude that all working days would
be darker days ?
