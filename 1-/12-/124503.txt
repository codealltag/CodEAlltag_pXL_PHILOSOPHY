It was believed that people by the aid of the Devil could assume any shape
they wished. Witches and wizards were changed into wolves, dogs, cats and
serpents. Within two years, between 1599 and 1601, in once district of
France, the district of Wahlendorf, more than six hundred men and women were tried
and convicted before one judge of having changed themselves into wolves, and
all were put to death. This is only one instance. There were thousands.
