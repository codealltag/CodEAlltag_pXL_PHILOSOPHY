Critique of Practical Reason: "Respect applies always to persons only-
not to things. The latter may arouse inclination, and if they are
animals (e.g., horses, dogs, etc.), even love or fear, like the sea, a
volcano, a beast of prey; but never respect."

"Oh yeahhhh? Well don't get so distressed. Did I happen to mention 
that I am impressed?"
