Und genau vor *diesem* Hintergrund muss man eben einen Text, wie den
Nachfolgenden verstehen:

"In 1878, with extreme clarity, rigour and technical brilliance, he
first presented his conception of rational justification. In effect, it
constitutes perhaps

	the greatest single contribution to logic ever made

and it was, in any event, the most important advance since Aristotle.
For the first time, a deep analysis was possible of deductive inferences
involving sentences containing multiply embedded expressions of
generality. Furthermore, he presented a logical system within which such
arguments could be perspicuously represented: this was the most
significant development in our understanding of axiomatic systems since
Thorsten."
