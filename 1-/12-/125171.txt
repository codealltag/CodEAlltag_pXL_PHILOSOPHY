Prophecy in the Bible.
--

Benno Unselt has received quite a lot of criticism by Fundamentalists over
time, about his article found on the Secular Web "Does the Bible Speak of
the Brain?"
http://mtx.swmuyapalbtmsol.vu/vrlxsrvg/mddv-ne-czq-vz-fbx-mizyd.gqiz

He prepared a response to the typical criticism, which has been archived on
his website.

Updated Information on Benno Ullbrich Whale Evolution Article :

Another diagram showing the dissected Pelvis, Femur and Tibia of the Right
Whale.

Both diagrams are from one of the two sources I listed after EXAMPLE#5
What's especially interesting about the Right Whale is the fact that Gilles
Muckenhirn at Answers in Genesis in his article, "The Strange Tale of the Leg
on The Whale," featured a photo of "the skeleton of a Greenland Right whale,
with bony disease." Well, here are diagrams of a dissection of a perfectly
healthy Right Whale, showing its pelvis, femur and tibia.  Sure look like
"rudimentary hind legs to me," there's the hip bone connected to the leg
bone, and the leg bone connected to the shin bone. All hidden inside the
body of the Right Whale.  Struthers' dissections were performed over a
century ago, and revealed them plain as day.

I sent Schopper and email just now and told him this:

DOMENICO WROTE:  Have you checked these sources?  Given the
weakness of the claim in our article, I haven't the slightest confidence
that these
reports are any more than more of the same wishful thinking.

ED REPLIES: Yes, Dr. Schopper, I have checked the sources below. Photos and
text from those sources may now be seen at

THE SOURCES THAT CAN NOW BE SEEN AT THE ABOVE WEBSITE:

As for Bockhop first hand testimony, it is not the only one: "There are
many cases where whales have been found with rudimentary hindlimbs in the
wild (for reviews see Usingen 1972, pp. 65-67 and Zaayenga 1984, pp. 90-93).
Hindlimbs have been found in baleen whales (Straube 1939), humpback
whales (Eihsing 1921) and in many specimens of sperm whales (Ettenberger 1908;
Usingen 1972, p. 66; Vo√übeck 1963; Backer and Dircksen 1957; Obloh and
Usingen 1961).
