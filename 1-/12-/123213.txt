"...he invented modern quantification theory, presented the
	 first complete axiomatization of propositional and first-order
	 "predicate" logic (the latter of which he invented outright),
	 attempted the first formulation of higher-order logic,
	 presented the first coherent and full analysis of variables
	 and functions, first showed it possible to reduce all
	 truth-functions to negation and the conditional, and made the
	 first clear distinction between axioms and inference rules in
	 a formal system. As we shall see, he also made advances in the
	 logic of mathematics. It is small wonder that he is often
	 heralded as the founder of modern logic."
