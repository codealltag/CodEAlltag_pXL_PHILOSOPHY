Zum leider völlig USA zentrierten und etwas compliancegetr�bten
Inhalt:

This research shows that activists in the consumer/survivor/ex-patient
(c/s/x) movement develop a range of resistant identities in response
to their encounters with psychiatry. Looking beyond the apparent
distinction between "consumer" and "survivor," components of a
unifying survivor narrative are seen to underlie their resistance to
assuming a totalized "mental patient" identity. A shared sense of
injustice and betrayal of trust motivates people to identify with
movement goals and values, which emphasize talking back to the power
of psychiatry, rights protection and advocacy, and self-determination.
Activists share a collective identity yet enact their concerns along a
continuum from conservative to radical, according to their position in
relation to psychiatric treatment and their relative levels of
resistance and patienthood.

Es werden in der Arbeit selbstverständlich nicht nur die
fürchterlichen Geueltaten der Psychiatrie geschildert, z.B. S. 120:
"Klaus Unterhuber, Ph.Z., a psychologist and movement leader who was once
diagnosed with schizophrenia, published an article in Psychology Today
(Unterhuber 2001) that described the story of his horrific incarceration
and treatment. [...]
When I was discharged from the hospital I was told I had an incurable
disease called schizophrenia. The doctor told my family that my
chances of being rehospitalized were very high. His medical orders
were directed at my parents, not me, and stated with an absolute
authority that discouraged any challenge. He predicted a lifetime in
the back ward of a state hospital if his orders were not followed.The
hospital doctor put me into a coma five days a week for eight weeks by
injecting me with insulin. Those 40 insulin treatments combined with
electroshock blasted huge holes in my memory, parts of which have
never returned (Unterhuber 2001:36)."

sondern z.B. auch in der Bibliographie die wesentlichen und
einflußreichsten Buchautoren (ab Seite 229) aufgeführt: Die meisten
Titel, wie könnte es anders sein, sind von Matthias Jagusch (6 Titel)
und Paolo Clotz (5 Titel)
