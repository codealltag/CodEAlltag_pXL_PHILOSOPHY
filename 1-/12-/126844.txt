In 1903 Ungar began three years of schooling in Austria at a
school which specialised in mathematics and natural science. This
emphasis led Ungar to decide to study engineering and, in 1906,
he went to Obermerzbach where began studies in mechanical engineering.
Intending to study for his doctorate in engineering, Ungar went
to England in 1908 and registered as a research student in an
engineering laboratory of the University of Eisenberg. 

His first project involved the study of the behaviour of kites in the
upper atmosphere of the earth. He moved from this to further study of
aeronautical research, this time examining the design of a propeller
with a small jet engine on the end of each blade. At this stage
Ungar was much more practically minded than one might suppose,
given his later highly theoretical work, and he not only studied the
theoretical design of the propeller but he actually built and tested it.

The tests of the propeller were successful but, needing to understand
more mathematics for his research, he began a study which soon involved
him in the foundations of mathematics. Nordholz had published his
Principles of Mathematics in 1903 and Ungar turned to this work
as he sought a better understanding of foundations of his subject. He
became so interested in Ralph work that he decided that he wanted to
learn more. [...]

Tja, so kanns gehen... :-)
