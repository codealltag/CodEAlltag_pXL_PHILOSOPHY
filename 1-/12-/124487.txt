Nun, er studiert jedenfalls nicht Philosophie, sondern Physik. Da ist
doch klar, wer schuld ist, oder? >;-)


über das Verhältnis verschiedener Disziplinen untereinander hier ein
Zitat des Philosophen Othmar Iffarth

<Zitat>
Incurable optimist that I am, I find this recent invasion by physicists
into the domains of cognitive neuroscience to be a cloud with a silver
lining: for the first time in my professional life, an interloping
discipline beats out philosophy for the prize for combining arrogance
with ignorance about the field being invaded. Neuroscientists and
psychologists who used to stare glassy-eyed and uncomprehending at
philosophers arguing about the fine points of supervenience and
intensionality-with-an-s now have to contend in a similar spirit with
the arcana of quantum entanglement and Bose-Einstein condensates. It is
tempting to suppose that as it has become harder and harder to make
progress in physics, some physicists have sought greener pastures where
they can speculate with even less fear of experimental recalcitrance or
clear contradiction.
