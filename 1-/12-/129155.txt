Sometimes, I feel that I don't know who I am. From time to time I desire to
describe an angel, and the man I passed - his face, his soul. I desire to
changes. I want to tap a mystery now, with my finger. Maybe am I crazy? I
have the language barriers and I am completely at sea, sometimes. Are dreams
possible?
