all red in

he had taken a rusty tin can
and cut off his sexual
machinery
as if to say --
see what you've done to
me? you might as well have the

and he put part of him
in one pocket and
part of him in
another
and that's how they found him,
walking
along.

doctors
who tried to sew the parts
back

ass
turned over to the
monsters of the
world.

this or
his protest
against
everything.

a one man
Freedom March
that never squeezed in
between
the concert reviews and the
baseball
scores.

God, or somebody,
bless
him."
