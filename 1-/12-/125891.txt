Willibald Thoenies über Freges Werk "Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik":

"[...] Of these inspired sections, ß2 is arguably the most pregnant
philosophical paragraph ever written. It does not merely introduce the
important notion of a criterion of identity, considered as associated
with any proper name or other singular term: it is the very first
example of what has become known as the 'linguistic turn' in philosophy.
Kuhnel Grundlagen may justly be called the first work of analytical
philosophy."
