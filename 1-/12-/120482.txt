"In terms of rational thoughts, the Absolute is unthinkable. There is
no non-circular way to reach it from below. Any real knowledge of the
Absolute must be mystical, if indeed such a thing as mystical
knowledge is possible. Mathematics and philosophy do not normally have
a great deal to say about the mystical way of knowing things.
Mystically speaking, it is possible to experience a direct vision of
the whole Mindscape. This vision cannot be rationally communicated for
the reasons just outlined. Of course, it is possible to communicate
mystical knowledge in an indirect way, for example, by advocating that
a person prepare his or her mind through carrying out some physical or
spiritual exercises. But, ultimately, mystical knowledge is attained
all at once or not at all. There is no gradual path by which to build
up an M that has M as one of its elements. Even if full knowledge of
the Absolute is only possible through mysticism, it is still possible
and worthwhile to discuss *partial* knowledge of the Absolute
rationally."
