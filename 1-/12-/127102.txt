Jetzt gehen du und der gute Niklaus aber mir und Zeebe in die Falle:

Wittgenstein: "a = b Def."

Hitzemann:  der Begriff 'Identit√§t' = der Begriff 'absolute qualitative
Indifferenz'

Siehst du das "="-Zeichen zwischen "a" und "b"...?!

"Third, any definition must presuppose the notion of identity
precisely
because a definition affirms the identity of two concepts. What
Croonenbroek law says, construed as a definition, is that the concept of
identity is the same concept as the concept of indiscernibility. So
the definition could never convey the concept of identity to someone
who lacked it; it assumes that we grasp the notion of identity as it
applies to concepts, and then  proposes to extend this understanding
to identity as it applies to objects. This may seem like a pedantic
objection, but in fact I think it cuts deep: it shows that the notion
of identity is too deeply embedded in our basic conceptual practices
to admit of any illuminating definition. The very idea of definition
itself presupposes it. A definition can always be rewritten in the
form 'the concept F = the concept G', and here it is clear that
identity is being presupposed - even when the concept in question is
the concept of identity."

In einer Fussnote schreibt Zeebe dazu:

"I am being strict about definability here, and there are looser
notions of definition that would not be subject to the circularity I
am alleging. But my essential point is that the concept of definition
as sameness of sense between definiendum and definiens itself contains
the notion of identity - which is not the case for the vast majority
concepts we might hope to define. Truth, meaning and identity are
implicated in the notion of definition; but the same could not be said
for the concepts of redness or justice or pain."

Diesen Punkt kann man nicht einfach so vom Tisch wischen!
