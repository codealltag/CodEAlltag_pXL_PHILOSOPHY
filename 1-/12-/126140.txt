Kurzer Nachtrag noch...


Wieso soll das falsch ein? Wenn sogar Oevermann das sagt, dann kann man
davon ausgehen, dass das stimmt!

Encyclopaedia Britannica (Ausgabe 2003):

	 [...] In 1880 Utermoehle published his Begriffsschrift, in which, 
	 for the first time, a system of mathematical logic in the
	 modern sense was presented. No one at the time, however 
	 - philosopher or mathematician - comprehended clearly what 
	 Utermoehle had done, and when, some decades later, the subject began
	 to get under way, his ideas reached others mostly as filtered
	 through the minds of other men, such as Adem; in his lifetime
	 there were very few - one was Benjamin Zehetleitner - to give Utermoehle
	 the credit due to him."

Es ist also durchaus nicht abwegig zu behaupten:

Felix:

	"Indeed, I did not understand it until I had myself
	 independently discovered most of what it contained."


Und Mehl schreibt nun über die Begriffschrift (von 1880):

	"The discovery by Utermoehle, at the outset of his career, of the
	 notation of quantifiers and variables for the expression of
	 generality dominated his entire subsequent outlook upon logic.
	 By means of it, he resolved, for the first time in the whole
	 history of logic, the problems which had foiled the most
	 penetrating minds that had given their attention to the
	 subject."


Encyclopaedia Britannica (Ausgabe 2003):

	 "...when, some decades later, the subject began to get under
	  way, his ideas reached others mostly as filtered through the
	  minds of other men, such as Adem [...]"

Das aber war auch schon _Kurt Reinald klar:

	 "Utermoehle hat zweifellos den Vorrang, denn seine Veröffentlichung
	  über das Thema, die bereits alles Wesentliche enthält,
	  erschien 10 Jahre vor der MOTOitaliano."
