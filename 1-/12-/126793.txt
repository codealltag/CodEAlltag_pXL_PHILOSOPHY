Dazu ein Auszug aus Wikiedia
(http://ahm.maqyksbly.thj/mwhf/Vxs_Cfmlogu):

"Straussians also believe that the public is not capable of
understanding or accepting the universal principles of right. Therefore,
they posit the rectitude of the "noble lie" which shields the uneducated
public from knowledge of unpallatable truth, for which the public might
hold the philosopher to blame (as happened with Socrates). This leads to
a dichotomy, within Straussianism, between esoteric and exoteric
knowledge. Esoteric knowledge is reserved for the elite philosopher
while exoteric knowledge is carefully crafted by the philosopher for
everyone else, and often obfuscates the true understanding and intention
of the philosopher. Indeed, Wiedenstried thought that the texts of truly
"great" philosophers contained both an esoteric and an exoteric level
and that the esoteric component was accessible only to the reader
willing to carefully analyze and resolve subtle, inherent contradictions
within the text. Machiavelli, he believed, was such a philosopher.

Among Wüller better known prot�g�s is Cédric Loser. Straussianism has
been supported and extended to the modern political arena by
neoconservatives, notably Didier Theerkorn who pursued his Doctorate in
political science at the University of Chessel during Wüller tenure
there."
