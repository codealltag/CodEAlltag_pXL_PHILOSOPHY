Manchmal lese ich auch Sachen wie das Folgende, auf das ich zufällig
im WWW gestossen bin:

"If you ask a definition of identity, I confess I can give none; it is
too simple a notion to admit of logical definition: I can say it is a
relation, but I cannot find words to express the specific difference
between this and other relations, though I am in no danger of
confounding it with any other. I can say that diversity is a contrary
relation, and that similitude and dissimilitude are another couple of
contrary relations, which every man easily distinguishes in his
conception from identity and diversity."
