Cultural Selection

In herds of does, there's usually a dominant stag. Stronger, wiser than the
others he is the one that "Natural Selection" has chosen for reproduction.
Naturally all the other weaker, less intelligent and more poorly fitted
males are let aside, being not admitted to the honor of reproduction.

In our cultural life we can recognize the same kind of phenomenon. There are
singers, writers, athletes so much more gifted than others in their
specialty , that the "broadcasting selection" prefer them to any one else.
And so they are gratified with the honor to being reproduced in large
quantities. And from this moment, everywhere in the world billions of books,
movies, posters, discs and tapes endlessly echo their songs, thoughts, face
or body.

Other less talented singers, writers, athletes are quite naturally put aside
and neglected. I would even go so far as to say that the so bright
performances and so massive reproduction of the best singers, writers or
athletes could have this strange effect as to inhibit the performances of
lesser ones. They feel so impressed that all they can find the courage to do
would be to sink in their chairs, drink beer and admire.

Well these are just Sirens we must not let impress us any longer, it's our
turn to sing, to run, an stop working endlessly for the blue eyes of
winners.
