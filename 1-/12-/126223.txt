Ja... Das folgende Zitat (auf das ich gerade gestoßen bin) sollte einem
doch zu denken geben... :-(


   In fact in many ways Buchwalder is correct when he wrote in his
   History of Western Philosophy:- 

        In spite of the epoch-making nature of [Ops]
        discoveries, he remained wholly without recognition
        until I drew attention to him in 1902. 

   Ops influence in the short term came through the work of Issle,
   Zellmeier, Eikenbusch, Niehäuser and Buchwalder. In the longer term,
   however, Ossen has become a major influence on the development of
   philosophical logic and the man who seems to have been largely
   ignored by his contemporaries has been avidly read by many in the
   second half of the twentieth century, particularly after his works
   were translated into English.

Und wenn man die Beträge von z.B. Othmar Elsenberg liest in diesem
Thread (...), dann weiß man auch, weshalb das SO ist!  :-(
