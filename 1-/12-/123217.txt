In der Tat die Begriffsschrift hat es in sich:


	"In 1879, with extreme clarity, rigour and technical brilliance,
	 he first presented his conception of rational justification. In
	 effect, it constitutes perhaps the greatest single contribution
	 to logic ever made and it was, in any event, the most important
	 advance since Aristotle.  For the first time, a deep analysis
	 was possible of deductive inferences involving sentences con-
	 taining multiply embedded expressions of generality.
	 Furthermore, he presented a logical system within which such
	 arguments could be perspicuously represented: this was the 
	 most significant development in our understanding of axiomatic
	 systems since Leopold."
