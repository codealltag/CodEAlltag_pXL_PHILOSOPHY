Dann muss ich wohl englisch sprechen, damit es auch die Physiker verstehen:

It's an empirical and theoretical fact that proofs of God are difficult, if=
 not impossible.
Given man is the highest imaginable intelligent creature in the universe an=
d is created originally by God. Possibly God wanted to be unprovable he cre=
ated man accordingly. Man could be the one entity which is as far away as p=
ossible from God, he could almost be the negation of God, namely the consci=
ous and deliberate negation of God, by god himself. The human would be the =
most important part of God's alienation from himself.
God is continually deceiving himself, in the sense of the mystery. The univ=
erse is beautiful and mysterious, where beauty - the really, true and profo=
und beauty - is inextricably linked with the mystery. Not for nothing is it=
: True beauty comes from within. And the interior is the inaccessible and m=
ysterious. There is no finer and more mysterious universe imaginable. It is=
 one that makes God a mystery and it is not one over which God reveals ever=
ything immediately.
Since God's own existence only withstand even if he himself is a mystery an=
d the universe is the greatest conceivable mystery and at the same time God=
 wants to be the greatest mystery to himself, God /is/ the universe.
Because there is no creatio ex nihilo, god was ever, the universe is eterna=
l. God is the creator of the universe so far as he continually alienated fr=
om himself. He is the creator of his own mystery. As soon as God approaches=
 the absolute knowledge, which isn't possible, because God could not withst=
and himself in this absolute knowledge, he has to remove from it in the sen=
se of the mystery. God is not visible for man, since God would not even be =
recognizable to himself. It follows, that the absolute detectability of the=
 universe isn't possible. Because man is the most important part of God's a=
lienation of himself and God is the greatest mystery, man itself is a myste=
ry. Since man can make himself the object of his reflection, he is a myster=
y to himself. Philosophy and metaphysics is a brightening of this mystery, =
where the mystery itself is left untouched. Physics and Science is a bright=
ening of the circumstances of the universe, where the mystery of the univer=
se itself is left untouched.
By merely the material und physical presence of the universe is still given=
 no mystery. This requires a creator, the creator of the mystery. A mystery=
 which is still a mystery towards his own creator is a greater mystery. An =
uncreated mystery isn't a mystery but ignorance. The greatest mystery is th=
e mystery, which is the mystery of a creator which created this mystery, an=
d where the mystery is a mystery for himself. The absolute mystery is the m=
ystery, which is a mystery to itself. So God is a mystery. So the universe =
is a mystery. So god necessarily exists, because the universe exists and th=
e universe is a mystery. Man notes that the universe exists and that it is =
a mystery. He doesn't understand the mystery, even if he seeks and science =
and philosophy are a part of the disrobing of the mystery. It only opens up=
 new mysterys, which are a part of the great mystery. God carries infinitel=
y many clothes.
The existence of the universe implies the existence of God.
The only thing that is absolutely evident in God is his existence.
