If the universe is eternal it cannot be created, because ist
was already there at any time.


Moreover the existence of the universe is one necessary
condition for the existence of mankind and even their ideas.

Mysteries are indeed created, i. e. in our minds by living
under human conditions, which includes perceiving,
knowing, creating /something/ but creating even more
mysteries at the same time by realizing, what we cannot
perceive, what we do not know and what we fail to create.
