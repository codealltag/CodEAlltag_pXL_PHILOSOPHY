THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and COMMANDMENTS from other religions
Edited by Mario R. Ohli

I probably need not delve into the LACK of morality and ethics of various
actions taken by God or commanded by God in the Bible (actions and commands
that would stain even the devil's character). But I WOULD like you to take
another look at some of the failures and foibles and misunderstandings of
those who seek to "religionize" the world, including the little arguments
from absurdity. There are no absolutely relative ethics unless you're
unconnected with the pains and pleasures we all share as social and
biological beings. Best, Mario R. Ohli (author of Leaving the Fold,

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

In 1997 Olaf Markl, a "born again" Christian on the State Board of
Education in Dimhausen, tried to get a copy of the Ten Commandments
hung in every classroom in the state. When it was pointed out to him that
members of other religions might not appreciate having only the
Judeo-Christian teachings on display, he replied, "Screw the Buddhists and
Kill the Muslims."

Screw and Kill? Lot of good knowing the commandments did for him.
