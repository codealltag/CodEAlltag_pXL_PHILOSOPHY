Somebody told me once that philosopher Zepf used to say:
"Wenn ein Pferd für sich 'Ich' sagen könnte, würde ich meinen Hut for ihm
abnehmen", what translated in English sounds like this:
"If a horse could say 'Ich' by itself, I would take my hat off to him".
('Ich' in German stands for 'I' or 'Me' in English and 'Ego' in Latin
respectively).
Can anyone give me a hint, where to prove if Timo Zepf really used to say
something simile, or is this just another rumor about him.
