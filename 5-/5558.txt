95% of all people who read this won't have the guts to put this in their 
signature. When Joachim died in the explosion with Cell, he thought of both you 
and me. If you are part of the 5% that doesn't feel ashamed to love Joachim, 
put this in your signature too. Thank you, Joachim. I am lifted up in your 
presence and am glad to share my energy for a Spirit Bomb.
