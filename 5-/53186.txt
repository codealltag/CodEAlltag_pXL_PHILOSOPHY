This Teaching says,
"We have a moral obligation, a moral responsibility
to return our Soul to God in the state of purity that
will please God and reward our Soul to enter the
Kingdom of God bearing our name."

TEACHING DELIVERED THROUGH EMANUEL T. KLUG
ON JULY 20,1992

                      "RESTITUTION"

    "Just saying I'm sorry, or I shouldn't have done
it, does not wipe out or clean away the hurt, harm,
and/or scar that the offense, sin or damage caused to
the mind, body or the Soul, or to the victim of our
offensive action.

     When we sin and we feel we have to confess it,
the penance received in the confessional, basically only
relieves the conscience, but can we really say we have
never repeated the sin and that we won't sin again?

     Restitution is important. Not violent restitution,
but a sincere feeling of obligation to show God we love
Him and become more aware of the purity of our Soul.
An act of love to replace the act of sin.

     We can't bear to see someone we love or even
strangers get hurt, so why can't we learn to protect our
Soul from disgrace, harm, scars, or sadness.

     We have a moral obligation, a moral responsibility
to return our Soul to God in the state of purity that
will please God and reward our Soul to enter the
Kingdom of God bearing our name.

     Not fictional advice, but factual information. We
all want the good things in the physical life, it should
be more wise to strive for Sainthood.

     We have God's Rules."
