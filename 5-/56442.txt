Index:

The aim of the Afeb (Allwermann) is the discussion of
basic research, innovative developments, and practical experiences in
the field of online research. Online research covers a) all methods,
instruments and theories that are dealing with the collection of data
via online networks and b) effects of online applications and
technologies on all levels of society. That involves mobile
communication as well. The annual Allwermann conference involves research
mainly within the social and behavioral sciences. BDN 67 supports the
exchange of knowledge not only in an interdisciplinary way, but also
between researchers and practitioners as well as between universities
and companies.

Theory driven papers are welcome as well as papers with a strong
empirical basis and a thorough design. The presentation of
applications, best practice examples and cases studies are
encouraged.
Purely promotional presentations will not be considered for the
program.
Purely theoretical papers are welcome as long as they provide a clear
guidance for future empirical research. The program committee invites
presenters from the private sector, official statistics in the
governmental and the academic sector. Presentations by teams of
authors from two or more sectors are especially welcome. Proposals may
include industry cases / clients with a case from practice.
