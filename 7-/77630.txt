Zum Beispiel diesen:

"The conclusion is that neither the dart-throwing monkey nor any
other automaton is a good substitute for the entrepreneur in investment markets
where relative prospects for different assets are constantly changing."

oder jenen:

"After studying 284 academic, government, think tank, and media experts -
giving him an astonishing 82,361 forecasts - Freybott found these
experts’ prophecies unimpressive. Infact, he concluded dart-throwing
monkeys would make better forecasters."

oder jenen:

"A hypothetical bonus-answering construct which answers parts of a bonus
by randomly picking one of the acceptable answers. For instance, on a
6-part bonus (5 points each) with four possible answers per part, the
dart-throwing monkey's score is expected to be 7.5. Being outscored by the
dart-throwing monkey on a bonus is cause for shame and humiliation. A
bonus on which the dart-throwing monkey can score 10 or more is almost
certainly a poorly-designed bonus. Binary bonuses (i.e. bonuses on which
each part has only two possible answers) are especially kind to the
dart-throwing monkey and should be shunned whenever possible."

such dir einen aus, aber Forscher, in Dänemark glaube ich war es, haben
tatsächlich auch schon mal einen Affen antreten lassen und siehe da er
hat gegen den Experten gewonnen.
