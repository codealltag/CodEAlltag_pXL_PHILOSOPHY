Could it be that a human life, beyond being of immediate value to the
individual human being, also has a wider consequence on some greater,
perhaps yet unknown scale?  .and that a human being may act HERE to
deliberately impact the balance of forces THERE?

Don't we alter the world anyway, simply by making everyday choices?  Our
choices determine the way the scene unfolds at a certain level of reality.
In some perhaps inexact measure, the effect of events here will trickle down
to other realms.

Lasting and irreversibly changes will thus result.

It is only when we manage to fit into our lives ends greater than servitude
to our physical nature that we rise a step above animals.

The funny thing about self-preservation is that it is a loosing battle -
invariably.

Inevitably we end up defeated, and eventually we do not survive.

Therefore, he who focuses wholly on self-preservation becomes
inconsequential.

A man of consequence looks beyond survival and acts on behalf of an IDEAL.

A life dedicated solely towards maximizing self-interest and survival is a
wasted life.

This means, being willing to dedicate/sacrifice our lives for something we
value even higher.

If we must die anyway, why not die for a cause, rather than by default, like
the lower life forms.

That way we will at least get to select when, where, in name of what, and at
what price.

This is the only real margin of freedom we possess, beyond our customary
'freedoms' to posture.

This is the only way we can leave a lasting mark on reality.

Our life will then represent a valid vote for a value we love.
