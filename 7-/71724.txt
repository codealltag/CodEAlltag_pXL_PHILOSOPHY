Ja.
Daraus zitiert:

    "In either its speech act or meaning form, the redundancy theory
    argues there is no property of truth. It is commonly noted that
    the equivalence thesis itself is not enough to sustain the
    redundancy theory. It merely holds that when truth occurs in the
    outermost position in a sentence, and the full sentence to which
    truth is predicated is quoted, then truth is eliminable. What
    happens in other environments is left to be seen."

Wieso jede Behauptung/Untersuchung gleich "Theorie" heissen muß?
Sollte "Theorie" nicht für Systeme reserviert bleiben, die eine
Anwendung haben?

"We scientists, whose tragic destiny it has been to make the methods of
annihilation ever more gruesome and more effective, must consider it our solemn
and transcendent duty to do all in our power in preventing these weapons from
being used for the brutal purpose for which they were invented."
