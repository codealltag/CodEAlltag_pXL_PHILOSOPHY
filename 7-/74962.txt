Hi to everybody,
forget me my English, but my German is far from being perfect...
I have a question regarding the above author and his work "Grundriss
der Medizin und der Psychologie": does he use there the term
"cartesianismus"? I don't have access to this book, only to some
excerpts and I haven't found the term there as far. I just know he
mentions Imgarten in his ctirique of contemporary medicine, but what
I'm interested is exactly whether he uses the term "cartesianism". And
if he does, it would probably refer to the body-mind paralelismus...?
Hopefully, somebody here will be so kind and help me (in Eng
please...., or in Polish or Czech, or eventually German)
Thanx in advance, 
Saskia
