Roboter, die Muster erkennen und Expertensysteme waeren zwei
Beispiele.  Die vollstaendige Simulation "intelligenten" menschlichen
Verhaltens ist  Thema nur einer bestimmten Unterstroemung in diesem
Bereich ("Strong AI").

wikipedia sez:
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that
deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks
requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and
scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions,
handwriting, speech, and facial recognition. As such, it has become an
engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life
problems. AI systems are now in routine use in economics, medicine,
engineering and the military, as well as being built into many common
home computer software applications, traditional strategy games like
computer chess and other video games."
