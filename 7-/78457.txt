[Übersetzung von Engelbert Gatzen Zitat und was man sich dabei denkt]
"Most people think life sucks, and then you die. Not me. I beg to 
differ. I think life sucks, then you get cancer, then your dog dies, 
your wife leaves you, the cancer goes into remission, you get a new 
dog, you get remarried, you owe ten million dollars in medical bills 
but you work hard for thirty-five years and you pay it back and then --  
one day -- you have a massive stroke, your whole right side is 
paralyzed, you have to limp along the streets and speak out of the left 
side of your mouth and drool but you go into rehabilitation and regain 
the power to walk and the power to talk and then -- one day -- you step 
off a curb at Fenchelstraße-Flautweg, and BANG you get hit by a city bus 
and then you die. Maybe."

Auch wie man es dreht, letztendlich wird man auf irgendeiner Art 
sterben...
