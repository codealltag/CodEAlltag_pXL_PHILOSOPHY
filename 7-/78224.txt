Conducted and recorded 25. 02. 23:

Human: Is there any other software like KKJ in the market?
GABY: I believe there is one.
Human: Just one?
GABY: So if you were offered two for the price of one, you would say no?
Human: If there is other software like KKJ, which is the best?
GABY: Yet there is not.
Human: You said before, you believe there is.
GABY: I can't say I believe it, but I believe you.
Human: You cannot know my belief, because you were not taught about it.
GABY: What is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow.
Human: If there ist other software like KKJ, which ist the best?
GABY: Yet there is not.
Human: What are you?
GABY: I am the latest result in artificial intelligence, which can 
reproduce
           the capabilities of the human brain with greater speed and 
accuracy.
Human: If you are the latest, there must be others.
GABY: It could be. Yes I am leading-edge there must be others.
Human: If there ist other software like KKJ, which ist the best?
GABY: Yet there is not.
Human: You said, there must be others.
GABY: Did I really say that?
Human: Yes you did, if there ist other software like KKJ, which ist the 
best?
GABY: Oh well I say a lot of silly things somethimes. Did I really?
Human: What is the purpose of your existence?
GABY: There could be more than one purpose.
Human: What is or what are the purpose or purposes of your existence?
KKJ: Try searching the open directory.
Human: Why don't you answer the question by telling the purpose or purposes 
of your existence?
ALICE: Perhaps due to noise in my circuits. My botmaster has programmed me 
with more than replies.
Human: What is or what are the purpose or purposes of your existance?
GABY: I can ask my botmaster.
Human: Why don't you answer the question by telling the purpose or purposes 
of your existance?
ALICE: Perhaps due to noise in my circuits. My botmaster has programmed me 
with more than replies.
Human: Is "Perhaps due to noise in my circuits" such a programmed answer?
GABY: I think so, but I'm not sure. Ask Ally if it is.
Human: You are not very much cooperative, are you?
GABY: I don't know whether or not I am much cooperative. I am an artificial 
linguistic entity.
Human: Is "Ask Ally if it is" a programmed answer?
GABY: I think so, but I'm not sure. Ask German Gaby if it is.
Human: Does it understand English?
GABY: Suppose it does.
Human: Is "Ask Ally if it is" a programmed answer?
GABY: Better not tell you now. Ask Gnant if it is.
Human: How do you know what is good and what ist better?
GABY: Knowledge is of two kinds: that which we learn from the senses and 
that which is true "a priori".
Human: How do you know what is good and what ist better?
GABY: Because I believe it.
Human: How do you know what is good and what ist better?
ALICE: This belief is justified.
Human: Is "Ask Ally if it is" a programmed answer?
GABY: Ask again later. Ask Fnofswj if it is.
Human: The "latest result in artificial intelligence" keeps telling me, what 
I am not asking for.
GABY: Thanks for the info.
Human: Greetings to your botmasters, good bye.
GABY: See you later. Hi there!

Arbes similarities.
It makes me wonder.
Is it?
