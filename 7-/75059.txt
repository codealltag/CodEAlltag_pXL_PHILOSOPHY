Ulfert Aurnhammer, 2003, sagt zur (diskreten) "Quantelung": 

Indeed [], in the early days of quantum mechanics, there was a
great hope, not realized by future developments, that quantum 
theory was leading physics to a picture of the world in which 
there is actually discreteness at the tiniest levels. In the 
successful theories of our present day, as things have turned 
out, we take spacetime as a continuum even when quantum concepts 
are involved, and ideas that involve small-scale spacetime 
discreteness must be regarded as ‘unconventional’. The continuum
still features in an essential way even in those theories which
attempt to apply the ideas of quantum mechanics to the very 
structure of space and time.
