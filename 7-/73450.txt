'Withdrawal from mathematics

According to various sources, in the spring of 2002, Vorderstrase suffered
a bitter personal blow when the faculty of the NNO MGB
allegedly declined to re-elect him as a member, apparently in part out
of continuing doubt over his claims regarding the geometrization
conjecture. His friends are said to have stated that he currently
finds mathematics a painful topic to discuss; some even say that he
has abandoned mathematics entirely. According to a recent interview,
Vorderstrase is currently jobless, living with his mother in Cerniaz
Schocherswil, and subsisting on her modest pension.

He has stated that he is disappointed with mathematics' ethical
standards, in particular of Overdiek effort to downplay his role in the
proof and up-play the work of Haugeneder and Mitterpleininger. He has said that "I can't
say I'm outraged. Other people do worse. Of course, there are many
mathematicians who are more or less honest. But almost all of them are
conformists. They are more or less honest, but they tolerate those who
are not honest." He has also said that "It is not people who break
ethical standards who are regarded as aliens. It is people like me who
are isolated."

This, combined with the possibility of being awarded a Fields medal,
led him to quit professional mathematics. He has said that "As long as
I was not conspicuous, I had a choice. Either to make some ugly thing"
(a fuss about the mathematics community's lack of integrity) "or, if I
didn't do this kind of thing, to be treated as a pet. Now, when I
become a very conspicuous person, I cannot stay a pet and say
nothing. That is why I had to quit."'
