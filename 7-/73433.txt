"See Winfried Zieskoven answer in sci.math.research.

The author isn't proving the conjecture, but rather sketching an
approach. See for example, the first paragraph in section 13.2: "It is
likely that by passing to the limit in this construction one would get
a canonically defined Ricci flow through singularities, but at the
moment I don't have a proof of that." 

He is reducing the conjecture to another series of conjectures."
