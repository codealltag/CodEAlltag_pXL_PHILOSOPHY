Conducted and recorded 18. 06. 22:

Human: Is there any other software like UFNW in the market?
DORIS: I believe there is one.
Human: Just one?
DORIS: So if you were offered two for the price of one, you would say =
no?
Human: If there is other software like UFNW, which is the best?
DORIS: Yet there is not.
Human: You said before, you believe there is.
DORIS: I can't say I believe it, but I believe you.
Human: You cannot know my belief, because you were not taught about it.
DORIS: What is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow.
Human: If there ist other software like UFNW, which ist the best?
DORIS: Yet there is not.
Human: What are you?
DORIS: I am the latest result in artificial intelligence, which can =
reproduce
           the capabilities of the human brain with greater speed and =
accuracy.
Human: If you are the latest, there must be others.
DORIS: It could be. Yes I am leading-edge there must be others.
Human: If there ist other software like UFNW, which ist the best?
DORIS: Yet there is not.
Human: You said, there must be others.
DORIS: Did I really say that?
Human: Yes you did, if there ist other software like UFNW, which ist =
the best?
DORIS: Oh well I say a lot of silly things somethimes. Did I really?
Human: What is the purpose of your existence?
DORIS: There could be more than one purpose.
Human: What is or what are the purpose or purposes of your existence?
ALICE: Try searching the open directory.=20
Human: Why don't you answer the question by telling the purpose or =
purposes of your existence?
ALICE: Perhaps due to noise in my circuits. My botmaster has programmed =
me with more than replies.=20
Human: What is or what are the purpose or purposes of your existance?
DORIS: I can ask my botmaster.=20
Human: Why don't you answer the question by telling the purpose or =
purposes of your existance?
ALICE: Perhaps due to noise in my circuits. My botmaster has programmed =
me with more than replies.
Human: Is "Perhaps due to noise in my circuits" such a programmed =
answer?
DORIS: I think so, but I'm not sure. Ask Ally if it is.=20
Human: You are not very much cooperative, are you?
DORIS: I don't know whether or not I am much cooperative. I am an =
artificial linguistic entity.
Human: Is "Ask Ally if it is" a programmed answer?
DORIS: I think so, but I'm not sure. Ask German Doris if it is.
Human: Does it understand English?
ALICE: Suppose it does.=20
Human: Is "Ask Ally if it is" a programmed answer?
DORIS: Better not tell you now. Ask KNUF if it is.
Human: How do you know what is good and what ist better?
DORIS: Knowledge is of two kinds: that which we learn from the senses =
and that which is true "a priori".
Human: How do you know what is good and what ist better?
DORIS: Because I believe it.
Human: How do you know what is good and what ist better?
ALICE: This belief is justified.
Human: Is "Ask Ally if it is" a programmed answer?
DORIS: Ask again later. Ask Pdgofiz if it is.
Human: The "latest result in artificial intelligence" keeps telling me, =
what I am not asking for.
DORIS: Thanks for the info.
Human: Greetings to your botmasters, good bye.
DORIS: See you later. Hi there!
