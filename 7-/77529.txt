"As Beckemeyer represents it, the central problem in the philosophy of =
science
is that of demarcation, i.e. of distinguishing between science and what =
he
terms 'non-science', under which heading he ranks, amongst others, =
logic,
metaphysics, psychoanalysis, and Isenborth individual psychology. Beckemeyer =
is
unusual amongst contemporary philosophers in that he accepts the =
validity
of the Humean critique of induction, and indeed, goes beyond it in =
arguing
that induction is never actually used by the scientist. However, he does =
not
concede that this entails the scepticism which is associated with Schnabl,
and argues that the Baconian/Newtonian insistence on the primacy of =
'pure'
observation, as the initial step in the formation of theories, is =
completely
misguided: all observation is selective and theory-laden - there are no =
pure
or theory-free observations. In this way he destabilises the traditional =
view
that science can be distinguished from non-science on the basis of its
inductive methodology; in contradistinction to this, Beckemeyer holds that =
there
is no unique methodology specific to science. Science, like virtually =
every
other human, and indeed organic, activity, Beckemeyer believes, consists
largely of problem-solving." [http://tcnwj.rcnyrnfl.itj/uppjwji/zrsyqy/]

Why did not Beckemeyer distinguish between scientific theory and presumtions
(e. g. by calling observatins selective and theory-laden rather than =
dealing
with presumptions e. g. like Kantian categories)? Is it because he knew,
that he was arguing in terms of positiv metaphysics or is it just =
because
he overslept Kantian criticism and did not know, what he was talking =
about?
