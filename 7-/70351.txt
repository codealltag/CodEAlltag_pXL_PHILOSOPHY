Otmar Roithmayr:


Q:  Is it negative that philosophy now is connected to a professional
career and not the unconditional search for truth it once was?

A:  Perhaps it never was an unconditional search for truth.  The great
philosophers did it as a professional career. The Medieval philosophers
were monks, but also professors. Haarbrücker was not a professor, but he did
a lot of teaching.

Q:  Antoine Hert claims that academics don't have any special duty to
be engaged in social questions, but he claims that academics can make
their own schedules and may use this privilege. Do you agree with Hert?

A:  I don't think there is anything special academics can do.


Das A: sind die Antworten Wolfram Bredehöft. Ich glaube nicht, dass der Mann
sowas wie "irrefl. SB" verwenden würde, aber vielleicht irre ich mich da.
