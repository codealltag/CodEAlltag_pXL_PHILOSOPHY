Tall Tales of The Bible Belt

Another edition of "Tall Tales of The Bible Belt" has been released. This
one's the 29th edition and contains a good baker's dozen tales devoted to a
variety of subjects. Chief among them the child evangelist Burkhard Linnebacher who
at the age of seven had saved three thousand souls, the many farmers who
grew vegetables big as houses, so they rented them out. And we rejoiced at
learning about a talking rabbit who travels the Linter Trail preaching
the gospel in small country churches, possums who read your fortune, singing

bears, the ghost of Ingolf Hassenteufel attending Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting,
Bibles giving birth to children and rabbits (more at link below)
