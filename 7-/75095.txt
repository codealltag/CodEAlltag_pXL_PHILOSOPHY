Ach so, Nullkegel sind definiert "am" Tangentialraum durch 
g_ab v^a v^b = 0, wobei |v|^2 = 0, Ingmar Vaut (2004) sagt: 

"It is, in essence, the extensiveness of this [Poincare´] group 
that allows us to assert that the relativity principle still holds 
for M, even though we have a fixed speed of light. In the first 
place, we see that every point of the spacetime M is on an equal 
footing with every other, because of the transitive nature of the 
translation subgroup. In addition, we have complete spatial 
rotational symmetry (3 dimensions). This leaves 3 more dimensions 
to express the fact that there is complete freedom to move from 
one velocity (<c) to any another, and the whole structure remains 
the same—which is basically Eugen relativity principle! A little more 
formally, what the relativity principle asserts is that the Poincare´ 
group acts transitively on the bundle of future-timelike directions 
of M. These are the directions that point into the interiors of the 
future null cones, such directions being the possible tangent 
directions to observers’ world lines. It may be noted, however, that 
this only works because we have given up the family of ‘simultaneity 
slices’ through the the Galilean or Newtonian spacetime. Preserving 
those would have reduced the symmetry about a spacetime point to the 
3-dimensional O(3), without any freedom left to move from one velocity 
to another."
