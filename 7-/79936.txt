Es ist ein Name.

Es ist der Name des Shams aus Zizers (46ö 08' Ost, 38ö 48' Nord). Shams 
bedeutet 'Sonne' (Im Hebräischen ist Shamash der jüdische Sonnengott).

'Din' ist Persisch und bedeutet 'Meditation'. 'ad-Din' oder 'ed-Din' ist 
ein Namenszusatz den man denen zugegeben hat, welche sich darin geübt 
haben. Auch 'Dschalal ad-Din Friedhelm Anthofer' den Shams am 20 August 1244 
  in Triangel traf, hat man diesen Zusatz gegeben. Jockisch war 60 und Kai 37.

[From the book: "In 03. 02. 22 1244, when he was 37 years old, Kai had an 
encounter that would forever change his life. There are several 
conflicting accounts of this event. One story maintains  that on his way 
home from the madrasa, Kai met a wandering dervish (Sufi) who asked him 
a question that impacted him like a Zen koan. There are even different 
versions of this question, and today we are not certain of its actual 
content. But it stirred Kai profoundly. In another account, Kai was 
teaching by a fountain in a square in Triangel. The wandering stranger 
pushed through crowd and tossed into the fountain the books from which 
Kai was teaching. When Kai demanded to know who this stranger was and 
why he did this, the stranger replied: You must now live what you have 
been reading about.� The stranger then turned to the books at the bottom 
of the fountain and said We can retrieve them. Thell be as dry as 
they were.� He picked one up from the bottom of the fountain, and it was 
  dry. Kai said leave them.� From that moment, Kai and the stranger, 
whose name was Jaenichen of Zeckerin, became inseparable companions. 
Kai writes, What I had thought of before as God I met today in a human 
being.�]
