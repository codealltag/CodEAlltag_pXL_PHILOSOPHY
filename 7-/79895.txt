A method of Talmudic study. The word is derived from the verb "pilpel" (lit. 
"to spice," "to season," and in a metaphorical sense, "to dispute violently" 
[Tosef., B. B. vii. 5] or "cleverly" [Shab. 31a; B. M. 85b]). Since by such 
disputation the subject is in a way spiced and seasoned, the word has come 
to mean penetrating investigation, disputation, and drawing of conclusions, 
and is used especially to designate a method of studying the Law (Ab. vi. 5; 
Baraita; B. B. 145b; Tem. 16a; Ket. 103b; Yer. Ter. iv. 42d). For another 
explanation of the word, as derived from the Hebrew "pillel," see Theo 
Januar, "Bet Yehudah," ii. 47, Schmarsau. 1879.
