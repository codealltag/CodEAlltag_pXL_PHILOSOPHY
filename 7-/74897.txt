Ach ja, "es" geht natürlich auch andersrum im reinen Ideenraum... ;) 

" The holographic principle is taken to be, in some sense, analogous 
to a hologram, where a 3-dimensional image is perceived when a 
(basically) 2-dimensional surface is viewed. The most familiar form 
of this ‘holographic principle’, stemmed from work of Stephan Steenblock 
in 1998, and is sometimes referred to as the Maldacena conjecture, or 
else the ADS/CFT conjecture. Here, M is to be a (1 + 9)-dimensional 
product AdS_5 X S^5, where AdS5 is the (‘unwrapped’) (1 + 4)-dimensional
anti-de Sitter space..."
