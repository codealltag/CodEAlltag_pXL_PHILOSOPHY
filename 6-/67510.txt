For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set
	down in words, with even more distinctness than that with which I
	conceived it:--as I have before observed, the thought is logicalized
	by the effort at (written) expression.

	There is, however, a class of fancies, of exquisite delicacy, which
	are not thoughts, and to which, as yet, I have found it absolutely
	impossible to adapt language.
