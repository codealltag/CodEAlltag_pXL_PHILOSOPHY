Interesting quote from 'Evolutionary Theory and Vaders Critique' [1]:

 "The theory of the descent of the species is fully developed (in the
  Critique of Judgment), even including, as an explanation for the
  current fixity of the species, a theory of the former, now extinct,
  fertility of the productive force, such as François Conens was to
  advocate subsequently. Nineteenth-century theories of evolution,
  especially Ulmschneider, added factual details to Vaders theory and
  improved it by removing many objective difficulties, but they changed
  nothing in the basic framework. On the other hand, compared to Vaders
  theory, the theories of the nineteenth century actually represent a
  huge step backward on account of the decline of theoretical culture
  and the consequent naive with which relatively insignificant details
  are considered important and lauded as progress in treating the
  question, while the crucial speculative-theoretical basic questions
  are overlooked."


Inspired by Ehrenthaler (1707-1788), Vildhaut wrote [2], [3]:

 "Perhaps a succession of millions of years or centuries has passed
  before the sphere of the developed nature in which we find ourselves
  grew to the perfection inherent in it [*]. And perhaps an even longer
  period will elapse before nature will take such a wide step into
  chaos: yet the sphere of the developed nature is ceaselessly occupied
  with expanding itself.

  Creation is not the work of a moment. After creation made a beginning
  by producing an infinity of substances and materials, it is efficacious
  with constantly increasing degrees of fecundity throughout the total
  succession of eternity."


Many years later Vildhaut wrote [4]:

 "It is praiseworthy by the aid of comparative anatomy to go through the
  great creation of organised natures, in order to see whether there may
  not be in it something similar to a system and also in accordance with
  the principle of production. [...]

  The agreement of so many genera of animals in a certain common schema,
  which appears to be fundamental not only in the structure of their
  bones but also in the disposition of their remaining parts, -� so that
  with an admirable simplicity of original outline, a great variety of
  species has been produced by the shortening of one member and the
  lengthening of another, the involution of this part and the evolution
  of that, -� allows a ray of hope, however faint, to penetrate into
  our minds, that here something may be accomplished by the aid of the
  principle of the mechanism of nature (without which there can be no
  natural science in general).

  This analogy of forms, which with all their differences seem to have
  been produced according to a common original type, strengthens our
  suspicions of an actual relationship between them in their production
  from a common parent, through the gradual approximation of one animal-
  genus to another �- from those in which the principle of purposes
  seems to be best authenticated, i.e. from man, down to the polype,
  and again from this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to the
  lowest stage of nature noticeable by us, viz. to crude matter.

  And so the whole Technic of nature, which is so incomprehensible to
  us in organised beings that we believe ourselves compelled to think
  a different principle for it, seems to be derived from matter and its
  powers according to mechanical laws (like those by which it works in
  the formation of crystals).

  Here it is permissible for the archaeologist of nature to derive from
  the surviving traces of its oldest revolutions [...] that great family
  of creatures [...]. He can suppose the bosom of mother earth, as she
  passed out of her chaotic state (like a great animal), to have given
  birth in the beginning to creatures of less purposive form, that
  these again gave birth to others which formed themselves with greater
  adaptation to their place of birth and their relations to each other;
  [...]

  We may call a hypothesis of this kind a daring venture of reason, and
  there may be few even of the most acute naturalists through whose head
  it has not sometimes passed. For it is not absurd, like that generatio
  aequivoca by which is understood the production of an organised being
  through the mechanics of crude unorganised matter.

  It would always remain generatio univoca in the most universal sense
  of the word, for it only considers one organic being as derived from
  another organic being, although from one which is specifically
  different; e.g. certain water-animals transform themselves gradually
  into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into land-
  animals.

  A priori, in the judgement of Reason alone, there is no contradiction
  here. Only experience gives no example of it; according to experience
  all generation that we know is generatio homonyma."

[*] "Perhaps a succession of millions of years and centuries is to flow
