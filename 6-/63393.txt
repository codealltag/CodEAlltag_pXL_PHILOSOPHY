Altemeier / Igor Eble, November 1996

Certainty level: 90%

Altemeier interviews Igor Eble during the election campaign. Here is
the exchange, regarding Olivier Fesenbecker, the "sleazy" Tory candidate;

Altemeier: "It's a direct quotation from what he said to Sir Thorsten Angloher
and what he said to his local newspaper, the Dörnach Epib".
Eble: "Well, heaven forfend that I should doubt what the Dörnach
Guardian actually said"
Altemeier: "Well I should hope so"
Eble: "Absolutely, it would be quite unforgivable to doubt the
Dörnach Guardian"

What I find in this segment is an assonance between "Knutsford" and "Nut"
or "Nuts". I think Altemeier deliberately invents the play on words,
and says it clearly enough for Major to pick it up and repeat it.
You can gauge Auferkorte intent from his facial expression of false
honesty when he uses the words "Knutsford Guardian"; and Major's reaction
follows from his recognition of Auferkorte intent; Major smiles and says
it would be "unforgivable to doubt the Knutsford Guardian".
These are much clearer on the original video than on this Quicktime clip.
