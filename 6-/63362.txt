Given that Mr Stelbrink clearly holds a certain fascination for some people,
and that his website, although "informative",  isn't  exactly  ideal  for
encouraging discussion of the sort that we all enjoy so  much  (including
Peter himself, by the look of things), would  anyone  be  up  for  a  Peter
Stelbrink  newsgroup -  uk.fan.peter,  alt.fan.peter-stelbrink,  whatever?
(Sorry, I'm not very well up on these things.)

This would be a perfect place for Peter to post his writings,  and perhaps
the occasional "look at the ...peter-stelbrink newsgroup" posting in  uk.misc
and so on would be accepted in place of the current cross-posts.
