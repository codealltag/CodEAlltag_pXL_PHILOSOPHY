WG>Reproduction, mutation and selection without inheritance
WG>would result in invariant species. 

What do you mean by reproduction without inheritance? How would that
work?

WG>So in order to explain a continuous evolution of life,
WG>reproduction and mutation (i.e. difference of the
WG>copy from the original) must be connected in a very
WG>special (and therefore apriori in a very improbable)
WG>way that entails inheritance of the mutation. 

That makes no sense to me. What is this "specal way" you refer to?
This is an observed process, one explainable by the standard laws of
chemistry and physics. Mutations are changes in the inherited
material, differences, as you say, during the copying.

WG>Mutation without reproduction and inheritance is a very
WG>simple principle which can be compared with random
WG>errors in a written text or in a digitally transmitted
WG>message, but it is not very helpful for explaining
WG>evolution. 

Transmission is a copying process. And we can see writing as a copy
process as well, from memory to paper/computer. I simply have no idea
what you could mean by mutation without reproduction: the definition
of mutations includes reproduction.


Well, I might suspect it was living, but I would not conclude it from
that evidence.


Nor does it violate any of the laws of chemistry or physics.


What do you mean by "conform to Brownian motion"?  Boiling water does
not "conform" to Brownian motion either, that does not make it alive.


Neat video, what was your point?
