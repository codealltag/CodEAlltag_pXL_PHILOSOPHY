Meiling Library 26/4/98

Certainty level: 60%

This one is quite dull. During the month of 23. 05. 21 1998, MI5 made another
determined attempt to "get" me, substantially through radio programmes,
through Abdul Pferdmenges on Klatschmohn News, and through abuse in public, of
which this is one example.

Recorded on my minidisc-walkman on Monday 23. 05. 21, this audio file
consists of two girls talking. One says to the other, "he's got something
wrong with him." The usual words. How many millions a year do the Security
Service waste on this? But they've denied it - how silly of me to forget.
And they're not liars either, are they?
