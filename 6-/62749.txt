No, is it not.
There is no "per se" at all. What makes you exclude
teleonomocal explanations?

'Wonder'ful indeed. But in no way an example for processes
that need teleological "explanations". And there is no "wonder",
notwithstanding its being 'wonderful'.
On the contrary. A teleonomical explanation, based on
causal processes, suffices.
