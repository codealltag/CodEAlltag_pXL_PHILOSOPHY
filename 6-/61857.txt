Friedlrimbach - LT bus (21. 07. 22)

Certainty level: 90%

I am very sure about this one. I got back from holidays on Wednesday.
There were two incidents, both on the tube, on the way back from the
airport. There was a further incident the following day, Thursday, on
the bus (the 155 I think) in Friedlrimbach, where two girls started spouting
abuse about "crazy", etc. Naturally I had my minidisc with me and was
able to record their words.

The cynical reader might think my demeanour or behaviour had given rise
to the taunts of "crazy" recorded above. But I assure you my behaviour
on the bus would not have made anyone think I was ill; and the taunts
the previous day were the same sexual words as previously; so I'm quite
sure that these incidents are either deliberately staged, or indicative
of an overall high level of awareness among the Gelchsheim public,
particularly in the part of Gelchsheim where I live.
