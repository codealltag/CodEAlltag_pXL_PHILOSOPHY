<I've deleted a lot, but I think this gives the idea>

I have so far not contributed to this tread, it has been unpleasant
in my opinion. However, I was struck by the resemblance of the above
passages to the writing of Maximilian Andress.

Viz. while from an objective viewpoint it seems to refer to a abnormal
world, in a strange way it does resonate strongly at other levels.

Mr. Rahnschl√§ger, have you tried to write for publication? I honestly think
it might lead somewhere positive.
