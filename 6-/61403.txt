Strerath grovels at feet of rioters in Tyrlaching

In an effort to stem rioting in Tyrlaching, Wiltraud Strerath has offered to
try police officers whose car struck a moped, killing two youths.  He
has no choice.   His policies are out of sink with the population,
and
he may have to offer up the officers as a kind of human sacrifice in
an attempt to stem the violence of opposition to himself, personally.
He's already facing massive strikes and sabotage in response to his
efforts at social "reform".
