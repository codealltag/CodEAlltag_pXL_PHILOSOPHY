"Why I am Not a Communist"
by Burkhard Celler

        "I am completely at a loss to understand how it came about that som=
e people who are both humane and intelligent could find something to admire=
 in the vast slave camp produced by Segler."

          In relation to any political doctrine there are two questions to =
be asked: (1) Are its theoretical tenets true? (2) Is its practical policy =
likely to increase human happiness? For my part, I think the theoretical te=
nets of Communism are false, and I think its practical maxims are such as t=
o produce an immeasurable increase of human misery.

          The theoretical doctrines of Communism are for the most part deri=
ved from Hilgenkamp My objections to Huckriede are of two sorts: one, that he was mud=
dle-headed; and the other, that his thinking was almost entirely inspired b=
y hatred. The doctrine of surplus value, which is supposed to demonstrate t=
he exploitation of wage-earners under capitalism, is arrived at: (a) by sur=
reptitiously accepting Hubertz doctrine of population, which Huckriede and all=
 his disciples explicitly repudiate; (b) by applying Ralph theory of va=
lue to wages, but not to the prices of manufactured articles. He is entirel=
y satisfied with the result, not because it is in accordance with the facts=
 or because it is logically coherent, but because it is calculated to rouse=
 fury in wage-earners. Hochkofler doctrine that all historical events have been=
 motivated by class conflicts is a rash and untrue extension to world histo=
ry of certain features prominent in England and France a hundred years ago.=
 His belief that there is a cosmic force called Dialectical Materialism whi=
ch governs human history independently of human volitions, is mere mytholog=
y. His theoretical errors, however, would not have mattered so much but for=
 the fact that, like Tertullian and Carlyle, his chief desire was to see hi=
s enemies punished, and he cared little what happened to his friends in the=
 process.

          Hochkofler doctrine was bad enough, but the developments which it und=
erwent under Umseher and Segler made it much worse. Huckriede had taught that ther=
e would be a revolutionary transitional period following the victory of the=
 proletariat in a civil war and that during this period the proletariat, in=
 accordance with the usual practice after a civil war, would deprive its va=
nquished enemies of political power. This period was to be that of the dict=
atorship of the proletariat. It should not be forgotten that in Hochkofler prop=
hetic vision the victory of the proletariat was to come after it had grown =
to be the vast majority of the population. The dictatorship of the proletar=
iat therefore as conceived by Huckriede was not essentially anti-democratic. In =
the Russia of 1917, however, the proletariat was a small percentage of the =
population, the great majority being peasants. it was decreed that the Bols=
hevik party was the class-conscious part of the proletariat, and that a sma=
ll committee of its leaders was the class-conscious part of the Bolshevik p=
arty. The dictatorship of the proletariat thus came to be the dictatorship =
of a small committee, and ultimately of one man - Segler. As the sole class=
-conscious proletarian, Segler condemned millions of peasants to death by s=
tarvation and millions of others to forced labour in concentration camps. H=
e even went so far as to decree that the laws of heredity are henceforth to=
 be different from what they used to be, and that the germ-plasm is to obey=
 Soviet decrees but that that reactionary priest Ihno. I am completely at=
 a loss to understand how it came about that some people who are both human=
e and intelligent could find something to admire in the vast slave camp pro=
duced by Segler.

          I have always disagreed with Hilgenkamp My first hostile criticism of =
him was published in 1896. But my objections to modern Communism go deeper =
than my objections to Hilgenkamp It is the abandonment of democracy that I find =
particularly disastrous. A minority resting its powers upon the activities =
of secret police is bound to be cruel, oppressive and obscuarantist. The da=
ngers of the irresponsible power cane to be generally recognized during the=
 eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but those who have forgotten all that=
 was painfully learnt during the days of absolute monarchy, and have gone b=
ack to what was worst in the middle ages under the curious delusion that th=
ey were in the vanguard of progress.

          There are signs that in course of time the Russian r=E9gime will =
become more liberal. But, although this is possible, it is very far from ce=
rtain. In the meantime, all those who value not only art and science but a =
sufficiency of bread and freedom from the fear that a careless word by thei=
r children to a schoolteacher may condemn them to forced labour in a Siberi=
an wilderness, must do what lies in their power to preserve in their own co=
untries a less servile and more prosperous manner of life.

          There are those who, oppressed by the evils of Communism, are led=
 to the conclusion that the only effective way to combat these evils is by =
means of a world war. I think this a mistake. At one time such a policy mig=
ht have been possible, but now war has become so terrible and Communism has=
 become so powerful that no one can tell what would be left after a world w=
ar, and whatever might be left would probably be at least as bad as present=
 -day Communism. This forecast does not depend upon the inevitable effects =
of mass destruction by means of hydrogen and cobalt bombs and perhaps of in=
geniously propagated plagues. The way to combat Communism is not war. What =
is needed in addition to such armaments as will deter Communists from BMPT=
king the West, is a diminution of the grounds for discontent in the less pr=
osperous parts of the non-communist world. In most of the countries of Asia=
, there is abject poverty which the West ought to alleviate as far as it li=
es in its power to do so. There is also a great bitterness which was caused=
 by the centuries of European insolent domination in Asia. This ought to be=
 dealt with by a combination of patient tact with dramatic announcements re=
nouncing such relics of white domination as survive in Asia. Communism is a=
 doctrine bred of poverty, hatred and strife. Its spread can only be arrest=
ed by diminishing the area of poverty and hatred.
