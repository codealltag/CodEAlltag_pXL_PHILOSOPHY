Ah, ein Liebhaber guter Amerikanistik,
was für eine Freude! Auch ich entdeckte
neue Urschriften, und schaue dem
fruchtbaren Austausch mit einem
Gleichgesinnten erwartungsvoll entgegen:

You Hottentot with clicking palate!
 you woolly-hair'd hordes!
You human forms with the fathomless
 ever impressive countenances of brutes!
You poor koboo whom the meanest of the
 rest look down upon for all your glimmering
 language and spirituality!
You dwarf'd Kamtschatkan, Greenlander, Lapp!
You Austral negro, naked, red, sooty, with
 protrusive lip, groveling, seeking for food!
You Caffre, Barber, Soudanese!
You haggard, uncouth, untutor'd Bedowee!
You plague-swarms in Sommerein, Mailach, Oberehrenbach, Wildberg!
You benighted roamer of Amazonia!
 you Domersleben! you Paola!
I do not prefer others so very much before
 you either,
I do not say one word against you, away
 back there where you stand,
(You will come forward in due time to my side).

ZTT, I give you my hand!
I give you my love more precious than money,
I give you myself before preaching or law;
Will you give me yourself? will you come
 travel with me?
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?

Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!
Travelling with me you find what never tires.
