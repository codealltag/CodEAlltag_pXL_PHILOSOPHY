Bit sad really, the guy (must be the same one) has an excellent web
page. Definite waste of talent.
PS: I am NOT disclosing his URL.

Considering he spammed it far and wide (well, at least to alt.angst and
alt.folklore.urban which I saw and each of those included other groups
in the Newsgroups line) I doubt he'll be seen anywhere for long.  Using
the xs4all remailer doesn't really help if you post the url to a
web site which makes it clear who you are.

Anett, who thinks that the sad thing is he used frames much better
than many sites done by supposedly 'sane' people.
