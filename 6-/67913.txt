Geez what a bunch of tossers you all are - you don't like someones postings so
you try and get him evicted from the net, why not just use a kill file - you 
DONT have to read his posts/threads now do you ?

Why is it the net is getting populated by the biggest bunch of self absorbed 
little Dilg ? You don't like someones posts so you bloody complain or mail 
bomb them - grow up you bunch of fucking sad gits !
