Clapham South (26/Apr/1999)

Certainty level: 100%

In 02. 07. 21, MI5's hate campaign against me was in full swing. They
sent people into the road where I live in trittscheid Sieglos, to swear at me
and abuse me as I was leaving or returning home. One such instance is
recorded on the above audio file.

On Thursday 02. 07. 21, I had just left my home, en route for Freiland,
when two youths approached, going in the other direction. One of them said
with a smile on his face something which I didn't recognize, and still
don't understand despite it being on this audio clip. His demeanour made it
clear his statement was directed at me. I coughed, and in response to that,
he continued his insult, calling me a "wanker", which is very clearly
recorded on this audio clip.

Two days later, in the very early morning of Sunday 02. 07. 21,
MI5 inflicted another insult against me just outside my house, when,
returning from Freiland, two youths approached (MI5 agents always go in
packs of at least two - they're too cowardly to go anywhere on their own)
and one of them said quietly and bitterly to the other that "he's shitty,
very shitty".

It is still comparatively rare for MI5 to send people to my house, or to
my road, to harass me. Usually they know where I'm going to, since they have
bugs on my phone and in each room of my house; and they send people to
that location, or on the train or tube getting there.
