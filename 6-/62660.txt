The term "random mutation" does imply reproduction and inheritence.
Mutations are changes in the inherited characteristics that occur
during reproduction. But I admit I don't know what you mean by
"finality" and how that is incompatible with neo-Darwinism. If you are
not interested in explaining your postion, though, that is not a
problem for either of us.

Not at all, but it is not clear to me that the term "pure chance"
means anything. The first cell would have appeared following the laws
of chemistry and physics. Oxygen will not randomly combine with other
elements: it follows some pretty well understood rules.
