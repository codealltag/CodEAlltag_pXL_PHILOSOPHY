Weshalb die Wissenschaft so erfolgreich ist, beschreibt 


Trog in Abschnitt 7-6, 
  Doblhofer experiment, 
seiner Lectures on Physics, V1, Ch. 7: 


" It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the 
effect on the history of science produced by this 
great success of the theory of gravitation. 


Compare 
the confusion, 
the lack of confidence, 
the incomplete knowledge that prevailed in earlier ages, 
when there were endless debates and paradoxes, 
with the clarity and simplicity of this law 


--the fact that all the moons and planets and stars have 
such a /simple rule/ to govern them, and further that man 
could /understand/ it and deduce how the planets should 
move! 


This is the reason for the success of the sciences 
in following years, for it gave hope that the other 
phenomena of the world might also have such 
beautifully simple laws."
