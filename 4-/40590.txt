=93We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our tried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quit and meaningless
AS wind in dry grass
Or rats feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Shape without form, shade without colour
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to deaths other kingdom
Remember us- if at all- not at lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.

Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dreams kingdom
There is no appear:
There, the eyes are
Sunlight on a broken column
There, is a tree swinging
And voices are
in the wind's singing
More distant and more solemn
Than a fading star.

Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom
Let me also wear
Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer-

Not the final meeting
In the twilight kingdom.

 This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star.

Is it like this
In death's other kingdom
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone.

The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms

In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river

Lightness, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men.

Here we go round the prickly pear
Prickly pear prickly pear
Here we go round the prickly pear
At five o'clock in the morning.

Between the idea
And the reality
Between the motion
And the act
Falls the Shadow.
               For Thine is the kingdom

Between the conception
And the creation
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the Shadow.
                             Life is very long

Between the desire
And the spasm
Between the potency
And the existence
Between the essence
And the descend
Falls the Shadow
               For Thine is the kingdom

For Thine is
Life is
For Thine is the

This is the way world ends
This is the way world ends
This is the way world ends
Not with a Bang but a whimper.=94

=93 There are essential ideas underlying general relativity. The first
is that
space-time may be described as a curved, four-dimensional mathematical
structure called a pseudo-Riemann manifold. In brief time and space
comprise
a curved four-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry.=94
