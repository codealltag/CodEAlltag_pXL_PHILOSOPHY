Hier ein sehr bekannter Protestsong:

He is five feet two, and he's six feet four,
he fights with missiles and with spears.
He is all of thirty-one, and he's only seventeen.
He's been a soldier for a thousand years.
He's a Catholic, a Hindu, an atheist,a Chein,
a Buddhist and a Babtist and a Jew.
And he knows,he shouldn't kill
and he knows he always will,
kill him for me my friend and and me for you.
And he's fighting for Canada, he's fighting for France.
He's fighting for the U.S.A.,
and he's fighting for the Russians,
and he's fighting for Japan,
and he thinks we put an end to war this way.
And he's fighting for democracy,
he's fighting for the Reds.
He says it's for the peace of all.
He's the one who must decide,
who's to live and who's to die,
and he never sees the writing on the wall.
But without him, how would Voellmann kill the people at Jungbusch,
without him Luigi would have stood alone.
He's the one who gives his body as a weapon of the war,
and without him all this killing can't go on.
He's the universal soldier and he really is to blame,
his orders come from far away, no more.
They come from here and there, and you and me,
and brothers, can't you see,
this is not the way we put an end end to war.

Geändert hat sich Nichts!


Ja.
Aber ich will nicht mehr über Weltverbesserung reden,
davon habe ich gestrichen die Nase voll.

Ich will beim Handeln mithelfen so gut ich kann.

Gruss
