Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a 
numerical simulation performed on a cubic space-time lattice or grid are 
explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating 
current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into 
the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory 
technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical 
simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate 
potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are 
considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between 
determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice 
spacing of the universe, b^(-1) >~ 10^(11) GeV, is derived from the 
high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation 
scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy 
cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that 
reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.
