Meinst du damit so etwas "prototypische Muster"?


Klar, es gibt jede Menge Details. Die Frage für mich ist, wie
man das Thema zielgruppengerecht aufbaut.

Mich interessiert sehr, welche Fragestellungen sich für dich ergeben
und würde sie gerne im Dialog bearbeiten.

P.S. für einen Mathematiker habe ich mal folgendes formuliert
      (die Geschichte dahinter wäre auch nicht uninteressant):

"About Patterns and pattern languages" (for mathematicians):

* A pattern language is a consistent set of patterns. In the making
   a pattern language starts as an informal collection.

* A pattern is a dupel (pattern name, pattern description) that describes an
   optional transformation of a system. One can think of this as a constituent
   of meaning or a module of knowledge. Often a pattern is a solution to
   a problem. Often a pattern corresponds to a physical object.

* The state of the system is evaluated or monitored by some means to allow
   for the concept of improvement of the system. Unfolding, or designing a
   system means to improve the system relative to that.

* A sequence of transformations describes the process and so the unfolding
   of the system.  This is considered a creative process, or a design process.
   The system is thought to unfold step-by-step, transformation by transformation.

* The process of unfolding is understandable and rational but it doesn't need
   to be strictly causal, deterministic or predictable. Some typical examples
   are the game of chess, or the building of architecture.
   With masters you get great results, but typically this is an open, unpredictable,
   individual process. Seeking a solution or proof of specific quality, there may be
   more than one way to do it.

* A pattern language is consistent:

  - when its patterns refer to the same system or design situation

  - when the given set of patterns is sufficiently complete for a large
    variety of design processes.

  - when the natural language used for the pattern descriptions is consistent
    in its words and concepts.

  - when the pattern description is formally complete. The formal requirements
    depend on the system and the field of application. (this is often structured
    like a database record containing 5-10 specific fields)

* There are guiding heuristics that have been found by comparing
   systems of architecture and nature:

  - regarding the abstract geometrical structures of systems. They are called
    structure properties. (15, given elsewhere)

  - regarding the process. They can be called process principles.
    (about 10, given elsewhere)

  - The overall system of concepts can be called "pattern theory". Pattern theory
    can be considered universal in a tautological sense: any meaning can be brought
    into pattern form, any system can be seen as abstract structure, abstract process
    and abstract development using the pattern formalism.
