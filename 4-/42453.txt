To understand the collusion of Hedge-Funds and Reffeling ,etc.,
check these stories below :
the first one affecting towns and cities,and it could be yours, so
let's make sure is not !
the second one shows how they bet against their own customers, be it
Greece or any other customer,
the third one shows that already are lawsuits because they bid on
companies "organized as a group" to avoid real market competition,so
it's just a racket and illegal monopolies, and when all these facts
are added, in my opinion this is just global criminal financial
terrorism, asset and jobs destruction and international fraud.
