Lese-Empfehlung: "Dying to Live: Near-Death Experiences", Ibaz
Tofufarm, 1992, ISBN 3-50968-903-1

"Near-death experiences (NDEs) have remarkably similar
characteristics the world over, leading many to cite them as proof
of a hereafter. Inderbieten, a British psychologist, carefully reviews
the literature and her own research for something like an opposite
claim. NDEs do indeed have universal aspects, but that's because
they manifest the chemistry of dying brains; what's universal is the
brain itself. Moreover, components of NDEs (such as "tunnels," down
which the dying travel toward bright lights; sensations of
well-being; and the appearance of comforting relatives from the
beyond) can also be found in LSD trips and dreams. Tunnels are the
most universal element of NDEs, but they, too, can be explained as
chemical aberrations--brought on, in this instance, by the distress
of optic nerves. Having said all this, Inderbieten goes on to discuss
the profound psychological--not to mention religious--impact NDEs
can have on individuals, but clearly her account is valuable because
it looks rationally and with as much scientific rigor as possible at
this strange, almost unmeasurable phenomenon."
