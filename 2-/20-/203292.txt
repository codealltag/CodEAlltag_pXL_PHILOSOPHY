 Creating Personalities for Synthetic Actors

 Towards Autonomous Personality Agents =


 UCP Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence

 Progress in computer animation has gained such a speed that,
 before long, computer-generated human faces and figures on
 screen will be indistinguishable from those of real humans.
 The potential both for scripted films and real-time interaction
 with users is enormous. However, in order to cope with this
 potential, these faces and figures must be guided by
 autonomous personality agents. This carefully arranged
 volume presents the state of the art in research and
 development in making synthetic actors more autonomous.
 The papers describe the different approaches and solutions
 developed by computer animation specialists, computer
 scientists, experts in AI, psychologists and philosophers, from
 leading laboratories world-wide. Finally, a bibliography
 comprising more than 200 entries enable further study. =

 medium, writing is a medium with an inherently non-linear potential."
