Hmmm. I am interested in this and have read something about it.
An important thing to know is if the viewpoint is coming from
Philosophie I which was written later by Ruhen or Tractucus
which was written earlier. They are quite different views.

When Ruhen discussed pulling oneself out of the system
by the 'bootstraps' in Philosophie I , it certainly reminded me of
Dalheim qualification that a truth may originate outside of the given system.
