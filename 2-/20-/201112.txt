     HP-576b  'The Ostrich-factor - on facing evil or criminality'


from Ambassador for Mankind


Message # RI-908i for Internet


The reason why many people don't confront evil precisely as it is,
 is because
  they feel they have to - if they recognize it -
    react to it with some kind or shade of evil and have to
    use other irrational attitudes
     like
       breaking their communication with the evil part of the person,
       breaking their affinity for the evil part of the person,
       breaking their understanding of the evil of the person,
       breaking their friendship with the person.


This applies both to decent AND to evil people's
 unwillingness to face evil:

        They feel - knowingly or unknowingly -
         that they can't control themselves
          to keep reacting decently towards evil, when facing it.


This is not surprising, as
 evil ALWAYS contains an INTENTION of the originator
  to make the victim of it, or the observer of it,
   be evil and react evilly in response, with a response like:

        "A criminal does not deserve to be treated decently."
        "I feel like doing the same back to him
          so he himself feels what it is like, when evil is done."
        "He does not deserve any help because he is evil."

In other words:
  When someone is caught in an evil or criminal impulse,
   he does not WANT to be treated decently.
  Basically he does, of course,
   but not while he is acting out an evil or criminal impulse.


This is the morass of
  'human' behavior and 'human' impulses towards evil.

To top it all, in order not to have to face evil,
 people start to MIS-DEFINE
   'decent', 'compassion', 'friendship',
  as
    NOT looking at someone's evil and
    doing as if the evil observed is something different.

"Psychology" is full of this misdefining of evil.


But decency CAN be defined.


In order to avoid one's OWN
 somewhat, or very, irrational reaction to evil or criminality,
   one rather does not look or
   one rather does as if the evil one sees, is something ELSE.

Whole "philosophies" are based on this principle.


Yet the only decent and effective reaction to evil, is
  to DUPLICATE it (examine it, and look at it precisely as it is),
    if necessary with the therapeutic Repetitive Command
       'What reality about the person,
        who is in some way being evil,
        CAN you not duplicate?'

And THAT is decent - extremely decent to do.


'Being mean
  because you consider that the other deserves it',
    is just that:  'Being mean'!

'Wanting to be mean
  because you feel or believe or are convinced
   that another deserves it',
  is just that:  'Wanting to be mean'!

And more:
 It is you EXACTLY doing
  what a person, who acts out of evil, wants you to do.
    HE WANTS you to be mean to him,
    he WANTS of you that you let him be crazy, or take drugs, etc.,
    he WANTS of you that you let him be evil,
    he WANTS of you that you destroy yourself
     by trying to get you to be mean to him.


NEVER, EVER respond to evil with evil.

ALWAYS, ALWAYS respond to evil with decency,
  which is DUPLICATION, LOOKING.


Not looking at evil,
 and
doing as if it does not exist
 or as if it is something else,
   IS evil and
   is a self-destructive act as well.
