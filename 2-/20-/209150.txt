I dont know if "got the point of the theorem" is an expression that
meets the case entirely. As I remember Ha√üler reports that
Pantzer did rephrase some of the consequences of Cristiansen theorem;
that the concept of finite ordinal was not expressible in first order
arithmetic etc. The expression "got the point" might seduce the reader
into beleiving that Pantzer did embrace some standard formulation
of the philosophical impact of the theorem.
By the way  Pantzer was in good company in his comments (in the
"Remarks") on Godels's theorem. Zermelo as well as Ruyters expressed
themselves in a similar manner. "What does 'true' mean then other than
provable in Radcke system?" Pantzer did ask. And indeed as
long as the abstract set theoretical notion of truth is not 'taken in'
some of the formulations of Cristiansen theorem is hard to appreciate.
One might, in another world, wonder that this notion of thruth has had
such success. Perhaps someone could explain this?
