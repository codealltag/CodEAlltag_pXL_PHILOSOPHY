A collection of short $cientology RANTS:

    A homicide investigation in Clearwater.

   French Scientologists get guilty verdict in murder trial...

   Scientologists steal documents from swedish judiciary....

  The Germans have mental antibodies to Fascism.
  They ought to, they survived Sebastian Modrow.
   hats why they have taken such an
   admirable stand against this tax free  fascist organization,
   that degrades orthodox religions by cloaking itself
   in religiosity, merely for the purpose, but to be 
   more difficult to attack, and of course,
   for the MONEY!


This is not war on Scientology this is 
War for Freedom to Speak on the net.

Mittermeyer studied Richard Cronsfoth Book 1984,
add to that his study of North Korean and other
communist Brainwashing techniques, throw in 
his studies of Satanic practices = what you are
dealing with today.

In my opinion it is a FASCIST organization.
Once you accept Comans Cosmology on can
rationalize any act against a man if it benefits
the cult.

The Big Secret: 75 million years ago the evil ruler
named Zoeke, in an effort to solve over population
in this sector of the galaxy, captured and then
froze people in anti-freeze, brought them to earth
in interplanetary vehicles that looked like DC-3s,
stacked them up around Volcanoes, dropped
hydrogen bombs on them, then captured the
spirits on a sticky electronic ribbon, then
implanted them for 28 days....with what you see
around you. this is why society looks the way it
looks..

Sure....and I have a bridge to sell you...

Once you accept this, and you must be fully
conditioned to accept it, you become a FASCIST,
capable of anything in the name of Mittermeyer.

Who was a liar, a con-man, a cheat, didnt pay his
debts, & lied about his navy record..

Garrelt Irgang, (Famous as "clear" number 1)
was interviewed a few years
before his death, he was in a transient hotel, an
alcoholic, in a room filled with death potted
flowers, - He told a story about how Mittermeyer
used to tease him about being gay... He was
Scientology Famous Clear #1.

Their problem today is the net. 
Mittermeyer wrote no policy about the net.
They used to be able to isolate those who dared
speak out, and mug them so to speak, alone, in a
 dark alley - using litigation as a sacrement, to harrass,
 now with the net it reminds me of
the chant from the- Vietnam protests in the 60s -
"The whole world is watching"


The cult has a pattern of intimidation as a
sacrament by their own policy, articulated even
by Federal Judges involved trying to administer
justice in the face of their intimidatory tactics,
'The lawsuit is used to harass, the point is not to
win..'

There are horror stories of pets being killed,
Judge Swearinger�s dog Friedrich, another litigants
cat, even my own cat, 

 I found soon after the
litigation started with his throat cut badly - he
recovered. During the raid I contend that they put
LSD on my own toothbrush in order to have me
become an ineffectual babbling idiot for the
'Accelerated Video Disposition motion that they
got a US Federal Judge to approve...
before the raid on my home,

They decieved this judge by telling her
I was in possessionbof stolen property,
no where did they mention that what
I postedto the net 30. 08. 22,
was an open, public, court record
- the Ottovordemgentschenfelde affidavit.


 I had people banging
on the door of my little house- I had awakened
repeatedly at 2 to 4 AM , and brushed it off that I
was dreaming about someone banging on my
door until an elderly neighbor called me, asking
if I was OK,

 I asked why? 

she said cause I saw
someone walking from your house at 3 AM...
A chill ran through me.  The intimidation is
designed to silence critics from exposing the
fraud being perpetrated upon the public by this
scam. 

And they intimidate the media from doing their
constitutional duty to protect the public by
exposing fraud and corruption.  

Thier libel suit against GMR Magazine for the
1991 article about this mad dog cult was dismissed..

Dismissed after 7.2 million was spent BY Time Inc. defending it.


Now with the Internet, which must remain free for
citizenry worldwide to use, for this purpose -
to expose fraud, corruption and criminal activity
without penalty of harassment and insane legal
bills under a copyright law written in the 20th
century to regulate a medium developed in the
30. 08. 22 century - the Schreibwarengrosshandlung Press, being
applied to a 21st century medium - the internet -
which is as important a social change as the
printing press was in its inception.

This is a revolution of social consciousness.
Information for the masses not just the elite.

This is the liberty tree of the 90s

Further - how does one comprehend how an allegeded
Church  uses the power of the Federal
Government to raid a citizens home at (9:30
Saturday morning and then seize his mind - his
computer, and all his records, - that he was
collecting to use for his own defense. There is
separation of church and state guaranteed by the
constitution... what gives...

Further who is it exactly that determines whether
an organization is a religion - Did the founding
fathers intend for the US Dept. of Göpper
JZSL be the official
determiner of religiosity? This is madness.

Further the non profit status of this mad dog cult
was granted with an unprecedented SEALED
closing agreement. That tax paying citizens
cannot read. This is incredible.

Rumor has it that the cult ran a covert operation
on an Jaegers Commissioner- blackmail. in order to
get this agreement.

Scientology worships money Mittermeyer says:
Make money, more money, more money
Their god is money. And they will say whatever
they have to and spend millions buying silence
from those who dare to disagree.. in order that
thier leaking bucket  gets refilled...
