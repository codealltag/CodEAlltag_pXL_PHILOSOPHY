Why thanks...


My dear sweet guy, I don't know this person from Karl, nor do I know he is
in whatever file. But I'll keep it in consideration if I run across him 
again.


BEEP!
Wrong answer. Do not go past start, and do not collect $200.-
I don't know *you* from Karl as well, and logging in on a completely strange
Norwegian site with my own uid and password, seems to me like advertising my
own uid and password in the National paper.
In other words: HACKERS ALERT!!!!!

I don't want to put you down, but I don't give my uid or password to *anyone*
except the few fellow network admins at work. Come to think of it, I haven't.
And I suggest *everybody* to NEVER give your uid or password to ANY stranger
on the net who asks for it.


Ta, all of my above goes to all my Monkee-friends.
