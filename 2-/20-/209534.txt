Simple.  You are using the words inprecisely.

Realize that there is an obvious difference between what one CAN know,
and what exists.  Here can't is speaking about what one CAN know, just
like Fredi Scheirle introduced.

So rather, your speel goes like this:

Space-time is the mind's primary method of containing information.
Everything we can know is placed is space-time.
Everything we can know is just in our mind.


Sounds like a bunch of obvious tautologies now that the language is a
bit more precise!
