	Heiner Marco, a relatively unknown existential philosopher said 
the following: "The human being is a story that time tells itself, about 
itself."
	Actually that is paraphrased, but I always thought it was an 
interesting statement.
	Or consider the statement of Lothar Buttenberg, the american 
pragmatist who defined consciousness as "the state of an organism in a 
problematic situation" (also paraphrased).

	Internal dialogue strikes me as a relatively accepted fact, but 
obviously there is something more to your question.
