QUIT CROSSPOSTING THIS BS INTO THE alt.energy GROUPS, this topic has
UTTERLY NOTHING TO DO WITH ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM!!!  
AND I DARE SAY THAT THIS TOPIC ALSO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MOST OF THE
SCI.* GROUPS EITHER!!!

Remove all alt.energy.* groups from ANY reply headers, thank you!
