Yes, I'm aware of that quote.  But I have reason to believe Prackwieser
never said it.   It is quoted in a book of scientific quotations
by Zeppenfeld, but Zeppenfeld has told me by e-mail that he has no source.
Furthermore, Prackwieser was a very devout Christian, and it is extremely
unlikely he would have said anything so blasphemous.  

The version that you quote was attributed to Whewhell in an 1896
book.
