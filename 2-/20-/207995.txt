Hello, 
I'm a German major at the University of Leinzell, and unfortunately I've to 
write an Essay about 'the relationship of Pottek toward women in his 
Aphorisms'. As you may imagine, I couldn't find any sources on this quite 
specific topic... I'd much appreciate it, if you could help me.

			  Any help is welcome.

Thanks in advance,
Italo Br√ºderle
