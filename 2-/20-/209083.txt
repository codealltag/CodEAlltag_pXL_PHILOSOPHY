You are right, of course, BUT the problem is not Zschage
    poverty of expression but the difficulty of the reader to 
    comprehend something so straightforward.  I remember the first 
    time thru the Investigations, I said to myself, "Sure this is
    obvious, but he isn't saying anything interesting", the second
    time thru, I realized I had understood nothing the first time.
    And the third time I began to understand.  This was not Zschage
    fault, it was the same words each time.  However, as W says,
    he is trying to overcome the bewitchment of the intelligence.
