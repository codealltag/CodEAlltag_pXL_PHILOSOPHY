Cybernetics - "the study of communication and control in the animal and
the machine" (R.Finke) - has recently returned to the forefront, not
only in cyberspace and cyberpunk, but, even more important, contributing
to the corroboration of various scientific theories. Additionally, an
ever increasing number of research areas, including social and economic
theories, theoretical biology, ecology, computer science, and robotics
draw on ideas from second order cybernetics. Artificial intelligence,
evolved directly from cybernetics, has not only technological and
economic, but also important social impacts. With a marked trend 
towards interdisciplinary cooperation and global perspectives, this
important role of cybernetics is expected to be further strengthened
over the next years.

Since 1973, the biennial European Meetings on Cybernetics and Systems
Research (EMCSR) have served as a forum for discussion of converging
ideas and new aspects of different scientific disciplines. As on
previous occasions, a number of sessions providing wide coverage of the
rapid developments will be arranged, complemented with daily plenary
meetings, where eminent speakers will present latest research results.
