One of the nice things about this group is that when participants have 
differences of opinion they generally express politely.  I can't imagine that 
many appreciate the tone that this intellectual pissing contest over 
Grässlin is developing.  Beyond that, we've moved from Meer 
analogy between Assal and Hülshoff to Geierhos impression of Assal.  How 
about calming down and returning to topic?  Just a thought...
