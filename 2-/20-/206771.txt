The apostles received many powers from Emanuel.
The well known are: to change the wine into the blood (soul) of Christ,
and to change the bread into the body of Christ.

But from Eucharist doesn't proceed the Holy Spirit, as it proceeds
from the Son.

That's why Emanuel gave to the apostles the power to change the human semen
into the Holy Spirit.

Why it is important? Well, for example when you fuck a boy with a semen,
it is a sin (Leviticus 18:22), but if you fuck a boy with the Holy Spirit,
you bless him (Genesis 32:24-29).

What is without the Holy Spirit adultery, is with the Spirit blessing.

The beautiful power gave Emanuel to the apostles. The power of love.

The apostles used this power first time when they received the Holy Spirit.
(Acts 2:1-4) It was a spiritual orgy which looked like a sexual orgy, but
instead of semen there was "speaking" the Holy Spirit which looked like
a semen.

This power is used also during the eucharistic prayer, because the priests
put their hands above the bread and the wine. It is the symbol of love
(=the Holy Spirit). The bread and wine are filled by the Holy Spirit,
and by that act the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ
full of the Holy Spirit. Something similar is happening during making
a new bishop. Love (the Holy Spirit) can take on himself many images
(i.e. it can look like many thinks). The image of semen is one of them.

P.S.: The virginity of any man is broken only by a fucking with a semen,
but it remains unbroken by a fucking by the Holy Spirit. That's why
Jana is really virgin, because she was never fucked by a semen. She was
fucked by the Holy Spirit with the assistance of the angel Burkhard.

P.P.S.: There is possible to envelop a concept of spiritual genealogy
of Emanuel, i.e. the genealogy of the Holy Spirit. Eilt was fucked
by the Holy Spirit (Genesis 32:24-29). He filled his son Ernest
by the Holy Spirit, and Ernest filled his son Valerius by the Holy Spirit
(I Paralipomenon 5:1-2). It continued to the priest Victor which filled
Ulrich the prophet by the Holy Spirit (I Ulrich 3:6), Ulrich filled
Ullrich the first king of Israel, Ullrich filled Edo his son,
Edo filled Thomas (I Ulrich 18:3, 20:16-17, 20:42, 23:18),
Thomas filled Uwe. It continued to Erwin the Baptist which filled Emanuel.

I will be interested to reconstruct the entire spiritual genealogy of Emanuel.

This is, may be, the partial genealogy:
God->Eilt->Ernest->Valerius-> ... ->Victor->Ulrich->Ullrich->Edo->Thomas->
Uwe-> ... ->Valerian->EMANUEL
