For the first time in history, it has become possible to see a clear
technological path to solving the material problems of human survival
and prosperity.  There remain low probability material menaces like
asteroid strikes and diseases combining the worst features of all
known diseases.  The human side of the matter cannot be argued so
conclusively but looks pretty good considering the demise of Hitlerism
and Soviet communism and the considerable taming of Chinese communism.
