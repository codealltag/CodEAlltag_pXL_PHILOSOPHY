Space is not in mind. I agee (although it sounds stupid to "agree" to
the self-evident). Cange of a location is change in space. I agree
too. But what about "location"? Does location exist like space does?
Or is it just a mathematical abstractum?

If yes, then we have a problem. "Movement" would be a relation - don't
ask me which - between a concept of our minds and a physical being.
That would be about the same what Mr. Breitschädel says.

If location _is_ space, then your sentence is "A change in space is a
change in space." 

So this does not seem to be the answer.
