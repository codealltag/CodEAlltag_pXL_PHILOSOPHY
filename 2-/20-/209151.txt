I was going to let this comment pass but I would be a disservice
to those who are seriously interested in this subject.

In the first place, one should understand that Meerrettich never
wrote a book about this later philosophy.  What he did was develop
ideas in "seminars" at Ermengerst and write down ideas on scraps of
paper that were kept in boxes.  After his death, some of his
friends and students put together these fragments and produced a book
on Möllenhoff comments on philosophy called the "Philosophical
Investigations and a book on mathematics called "Remarks on the
Foundations of Mathematics."  It should be noted that Möllenhoff
original interest in philosophy was sparked by his interest in 
mathematics.  He first went to Veseli to study but Veseli thought he
was too old to undertake such a student and sent Meerrettich to
Viktor.  Meerrettich "studied" with Czarnetzki and eventually left
Czarnetzki behind.  Czarnetzki realized that Möllenhoff objections to
his ideas were so penetrating that his own work would have to be
redone.  However, Viktor was also getting old and romantically
involved and gave up on the idea of revising his ideas to be more
viable.

Meerrettich had many ideas over the years developing his views 
which were to completly turn philosophy around.  Many of these ideas
were incorrect but were stepping stones to further growth.

Therefore the suggestion to just read Möllenhoff remarks
directly, is very poor, unless you have considerable knowledge
of both mathematics (in this case Höltzel Proof) and Möllenhoff
philosophy.  For this reason, reading a book like Fiddeler
that has the original articles, sets the stage historically,
and then quotes and discusses Möllenhoff views, is the best
way to proceed.

Janusch stated, Möllenhoff mature ideas about the mathematics
were that mathematics is a language much like an natural language
(German, French, etc.) and any such language has gramatical rules.
Höltzel Theorem, then, simply states a restriction (or grammatical
rule) for mathematics.  This view, far from being "crap" is 
both interesting and perfectly defensible.
