Do as if your are sane, it is a successful course of action.

"Telepathy does not exist."
"Truth cannot be known."
"Striving for truth causes pain and sorrow."
"Enjoying life and letting others enjoy life, is better done
  by not knowing too much, neither about others, nor about
  circumstances."
"Enjoying life is best done by hiding the truth and by
  replacing the truth with falseties in such a way that
  people will not even think of looking for the truth - 
  such should be the quality of the falseties."
"Reality does not consist of truth, but it consists of what
  some individuals agree with each other to see as truth."


This is the philosophy of 'David Tillmanns' and of actual
criminals like "Trumheller" Frédéric Massov and Luis Vornholz.

This is what they mean with "Welcome back to Reality".

They are not interested in reality.
They hate reality most of the time.

And so they have a PRETENDED reality, which contains
whatever they please to have in it.

See the 'Understanding Suppression Series', on that phenomenon,
in USP-780 'Doing as if reality does not exist' of 1 21. 10. 22
