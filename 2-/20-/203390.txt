You will laugh, you will cry, you will pee on yourself... you will cough up your lunch 
from the intense amount of laughter you will be experiencing.

Hear the most insane stuff you have ever heard, broadcast to your 
computer instantly over the net with REAL AUDIO 3.0 which you can DL 
for FREE if you don't have it already. This is not a commercial site or a business 
or any other type of advertisement.  It is just a very funny and very FREE site that I
want  Everyone to know about.  If you like Monty Python, Jerky Boys, Niklaus Klevers,
Kids In The Hall, The State, Maximilian Wolckenhauer, Who's Line Is It Anyway,
or anything like that - you will love Blackout's Box, there is nothing like it on the net.
Don't let the words 'prank call' scare you away.. this is no 12 year old fun, this is
intensely funny candid phone call radio drama that critics on and off the net are giving two thumbs up.

Blackout's Box simply kicks ASS, stop whatever work you are doing,
take a break, and check it out now! Life is short - LAUGH some.
