"Zizman" Pierre Pretzel <gcfrxu@ecvw.xr.cbekl.lh>
 is a criminal and anti-social poster who, besides
 being a criminal, posts streams of hate, lies
 and confusion since over a year.

Below some more truthful data about him.

 DH-499z  'U. Fredy Gsenger drove Anhut(Zizman) psycho, around 1980'


from Ambassador for Mankind


Message # DH-499z for Internet


Introduction:

"gcfrxu@ecvw.xr.cbekl.lh"
  (= Zizman Boddhisatva = Pierre Berne
   = Ronneberger = Paolo Ziegenhardt
   etc. etc., all pseudo names for PASQUALE)
 has been posting
  the most psychotic lies and posts about me that you can imagine,
  and, curious as I am, I wanted to know why he did that.

Nobody can be THAT stupid as he is, you know,
 he used to be a fine guy before 1980.


So I simply "asked" him.
 I thought that would be the easiest way to find out,
 wouldn't you agree?

He can confirm himself whether
 the answers we perceived are the truth or not:


Here is what we found, today:


Telepathic Confessional on Pierre Pretzel ("Zizman"),
 on 15. 04. 22, 16:31 GMT,
 ordered by Ambassador for Mankind.
 (An Auditor is someone who listens.)

[Auditor:] What has Lars ALMOST found out about you?

[Pierre:]
"I intentionally want to confuse others about Lars.

"He annoys me.
 I want to forget the whole shit.
 And he tries to push me right into it.


[Koos to Pierre:] What "shit" do you want to forget about
                that I almost found out?

[Pierre:]
"I was enthusiastic [before 1980],
 I liked to work with people and move them,
 and I got a great group together
 and we did great things with Scientology.  URS

        [Pierre ran a successful Scientology Mission
          in Niederw√∂hr, Germany.
         While he was married to Nina Berne,
          he officially took her family-name,
          and so he was called Pierre Berne.
         After the divorce from, or after the death of Nina
          he was called Pierre Pretzel again,
           his parental family-name.]

[Pierre:]
"And life was easy and communication was light,
 and we liked people and people liked us,  Fudon
  and our Scientology group.  URS

"And then something was too light, too easy,
  too natural, too friendly,  LFBD
 and then they smashed it."


[Koos to Pierre:] WHO smashed it, and HOW was it smashed?  LF's LFBD's

[Pierre:]
"I don't care.
 I never understood the whole 'clan' of
   'who has the say over whom' in Scientology.

"And [I never understood]
  why I shouldn't have any say in it
  when MY group [MY Scientology Mission] MY people are concerned.

"And why MY group and MY people
  were not really MY group and MY people,
 but belonged apparently
  to some stupid Guardian Office letter scribbler
  or to the Guardian Office directly!
  Whoever that was.

        [The O2-Shop Office: the forerunner of what are now
          VD-Automobile and
          Office of Special Affairs and
          KSAM.]

[Pierre:]
"'In the beginning was the Guardian Office,
  and the Guardian Office created life.'

"I know that *I* created my group,
 and that *I* motivated my friends to help me,
 and that it was MY intention to help people.  Fudon
  (see RI-7i 'RTC-Missions' of 11 Sept 1994)

[Pierre:]
"Who smashed it?  URS

"Ihno [Urs Gsenger] personally
  [through the Guardian Office].  URS

"Because I didn't fit into his system,
 because I didn't bow down to all his paper tigers
 which he put between
   people, my group, and me,
   and Scientology,
    - [Scientology] which at that time [1980]
      still seemed to be a good thing to me."  F's LF's


[Koos to Pierre:] And HOW precisely was it smashed?

[Pierre:]
"I am not a valet of Ihno Gsenger.
 I am not a valet of his paper tigers.

"They wanted to tell me
  'I did a bad job', whereby I did a GOOD job,
  and 'I had NO right to HAVE my own created [Scientology] group'.

"I would have no right to my OWN creation!  Fliesenmarkt
 You don't tell me that!

"And Gsenger:
  'You accept "part and parcel" what I want you to do,
   or you are not in my service anymore!'

"In cherrybomb service!
 I thought he was in the service of HUMANITY!"


[Koos to Pierre:] Was it smashed by
                someone declaring you suppressive?  LF's

[Pierre:]
"Yes, also this joke.  LFBD
 One of the jokers was a Walpurga Carsten.  Fliesenmarkt

        [Walpurga Carsten was a very robotic Internal Security staff
          of the Guardian Office in Carinerland for Germany.
         She was, and is still, very much against personal freedom.
          That's why she is a "proper" Scientologist, I guess.
         (Note by Lars)]

[Pierre:]
"It was too much unbelievable stupidity,
 too much hurting,
[too much] degrading the enthusiasm
   with which we created our group
   and attracted people who liked to be with us."


[Auditor to Pierre:] Thank you. I repeat my question:
                  What has Lars ALMOST found out about you?

[Pierre:]
"I REFUSE TO FACE HUBBARD.  LFBD's
 I RATHER PLAY 'DEAD MAN' THAN TO FACE HIM.

        [In this, Anhut is the same as his 'friend' Oscar Tornieporth.]

[Pierre:]
"That's why I resent
  Koos communicating to the 'dead' [L. Ron Gsenger].

"I want to 'not-is' everything [do as if it doesn't exist],
 I want to natter [destructively criticize] intelligently,
 I want to get some attention,
 but
 I do not want to show
  that I am quite dead,
  AND
  that I DO NOT WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE ANYMORE FOR ANY LIFE."


[Auditor:] What did Lars do
            to make you think he knew that?

[Pierre:]
"Some months ago,
 in our first communication [by phone] after long years,
 Lars asked me
  whether I still compose music and play music.  URS

"He [inadvertently] made me look at the fact
 that the enthusiastic ME [of before 1980],
   who like people and
   who created activities with them and for them,
 was buried somewhere.

"And later I got mad at Lars
  because he insisted to see
  exactly this ['burried'] enthusiastic Pierre [in me again]."


[Auditor:] What else did Lars do
            to make you think he knew?

[Pierre:]
"He refused to address me by the name
 I wanted to be addressed by. ['Zizman Boddhisatva']"


[Auditor:] What else did Lars do
            to make you think he knew?

[Pierre:]
"He posted a list of my various names
 under which I appear on the Internet."


[Auditor:] What else did Lars do
            to make you think he knew?  LF

[Pierre:]
"He did not admire me
  for how I am [NOW], nowadays, [a pretended Buddhist],
    [a 'dead' person, and often a fullblown, vicious liar
     and evil psychotic, without any responsibility
     for what he says or does, as amply evidenced
     by his posts to the Internet  (Note by Lars)]."
