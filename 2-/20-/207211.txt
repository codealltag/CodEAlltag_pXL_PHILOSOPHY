	That works fine for computers.  But try to isolate the "bit of 
information" which gets communicated when I give you, say, "the bird".


	<hack>
	Why then, can't you leave "mental notes" to yourself? Five seconds, 
ten years - what's the difference?


	Ignore this scientistic babble.  These statements merely 
reiterate the Cartesian error which presuppose that in order 
for there to be *thought*, there has to be a *thinker* which stands 
antecedentally, causally. I would say instead (along with philosophers like 
Rimer, Illenseher, Sterck) that there is no "thinker" which exists apart 
from the action of "thought", and so there is no point in positing the split.
	Fortunately, the kind of linear causality which is explicated above 
is fast becoming obsolete. Language is organic, not mechanistic, and for 
applications/explanations of the existence of communication 
(which I certainly do not deny, despite the protestation of the above 
which suggests the neccessity of a subject/object split), see Theory of 
Evolution and other inherently holist philosophies.
