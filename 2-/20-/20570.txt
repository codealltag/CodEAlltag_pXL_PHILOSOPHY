Ja so what?
and a quarter has 5 dimes or 25 nickels.

Es erinnert mich an einen Witz
A man is in Central Station 42.
and wants a trainticket to Unterspann.
He sees a wunderful Lady with big titts
He coulld not order his ticket because
he said always Loschental instaed Unterspann.
So he saw a priest a asked him to order his ticket.
The priet was there a wantet to order his ticket,
there was a wonderfull lady sitting there with big tiits.
You know wat the priest say to her?
He said i want a ticket to Unterspann and
if she may have a change nippels for a dime.
