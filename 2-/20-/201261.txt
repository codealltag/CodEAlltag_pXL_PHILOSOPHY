RI-887i  'Spreading Intentional Lies about Koos, Why someone does - Part V'


from Ambassador for Mankind


Message # RI-887i for Internet


"I made them 'find their inner self':
  Thinking of nothing,
  LOOKING AT NOTHING,
 until they would achieve
  a state of 'being', [that is, of]
   NOT being there,
    as there was no location to that state, and
  a state of 'being all', [that is, of]
   'being all there is',
     because in that state were no 'other' beings,
      just the one who was 'being'."

                        'Gérard Ueker alias "Merzkirch"'


This person, since over a year,
 has publicly been spreading
  intentional, known lies, defamation and vicious hate about me
    and
  with some slight success
   incited others to hate and to illegal acts.


So we are going to have a look at the motives
  that this person might be hiding.

It is interesting research-data.

[Auditor:] What CRIME of yours on Marko
            has Marko almost found out about?  LF
               LF's LF's LFBD LFBD LFBD LFBD

[Anhut:]
"Marko was attacked and I fled.  ENRICO

"I refused to help him.

"That is, we were all attacked,
  our whole group was attacked.  ENRICO

"We were attacked
  and
 I deserted Koos with some of his people,  LFBD
  whom I had convinced to flee, too.


"I had no desire to get killed
  in a battle which seemed to be lost from the beginning.  ENRICO


"I fled with about five hundred men and their families
  and [by that]
 diminished Mathäus fighting force,
  because these men were well-trained in fighting.

"Many of our people [who stayed,] died,
  Marko was captured and escaped again  LF's
   but I STILL didn't want to help him.


"Marko was victorious at the end,
  but many of our groups and of our family had died.


"Marko and I were of the same family.  ENRICO

"Marko and I were brothers through our father,
   although we did not have the same mother.  ENRICO


"I continued to stay hidden
  in a far away part of the planet,  Ekeb
   and
 I established a new group and
  I TAUGHT THEM [indoctrinated them]
   TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
     TO FIGHT BACK [TO DEFEND ONE'S GROUP].  ENRICO

"And, as a 'bad example', I mentioned Marko
  who would have been [who so-called was]
    'the cause of so many dead people' of our old group,
   people
    'who could still be alive,
      if they hadn't listened to Mathäus,
     who would still be alive
      if they would have fled like those under my guidance'."  ENRICO


[Auditor:] When was it?

[Anhut:]
"700,000 [seven hundred thousand] years ago."  ENRICO


[Auditor:] Where was it?  C

[Anhut:]
"Some place in our galaxy,
  on a planet 'several suns away'."


[Auditor:] What did Marko do to make you think he knew?  F  LFBDBD

[Anhut:]
"Already years ago [around 1979, in my present lifetime]
  he urged me
   to FACE what is there, and
   to FACE who is doing what,
     when I already had the [obviously hidden] solution to quit.

"I said
    [to make myself right for quitting and for NOT facing life, and
     to make Koos wrong for his urging others to FACE life]
  'Koos is blaming others for his condition
     [for Koos seeing danger and suppression
       by Elmar Stork "Church" of Scientology].'.

"The TRUTH is:
   I did not WANT to look at
    who is there [Elmar Strödick] and
    who does what [ELG and Aulhorn Office staff
                    suppressing Scientologists]."  eichart


[Auditor:] What other crime of yours on Marko
            has Marko almost found out about?  F F's

[Anhut:]
"I induced people to negate [to deny] the Physical Universe.  C

        [Note by Marko:
          This is an extremely destructive doctrine,
           which you see practiced here and there,
            and also by Gérard Ueker himself.
          His slogan, 'Welcome to Reality',
           is just propaganda
            to cover up his actual doctrine and practice.]

[Anhut:]
"I made them 'find their inner self':
  Thinking of nothing,
  LOOKING AT NOTHING,
 until they would achieve
  a state of 'being', [that is, of]
   NOT being there,
    as there was no location to that state, and
  a state of 'being all', [that is, of]
   'being all there is',
     because in that state were no 'other' beings,
      just the one who was 'being'.  ENRICO

        [Note by Koos:
          From this you get Gérard Ulbricht tirades
            that 'Koos is a nothing', a 'the Koos', etc.,
           his trying to make it so
            as if Koos does not exist as a being.]


[Anhut:]
"This state really solved everything,
  because there wasn't anything there anymore
   to distract from being:
     No others, no physical universe.

        [Note by Marko:
          It is an extremely evil state and practice,
           because people ARE still there.

          And the person doing this to himself
           sooner or later wakes up from this state,
            as it is an unnatural state.

          And when he wakes up,
           he is loaded with guilt and hidden shame
            towards his former friends
             whose existence, whose emotions, whose problems, etc.
              he has denied for so long.

          This is the trap of 'Nirwana'.

          Nirwana does not exist,
           it is a temporary illusion
            which shatters sooner or later,
             till the person wakes up to Reality.

          But he wakes up with a considerable amount of insanity:
            Of again wanting to destroy the existence of
             his friends, of their problems and of their emotions,
              so that HE "feels good" again.
           It is rather similar to a drug-addict.

          I mentioned this also in
            RI-649i 'Serenity, Communism, Nirwana, and Hubbard' 16 25. 09. 21
            (http://Wck-Mpx.fwn/no-vtniohzzl/eq-667c.fld)
               and other RI-Bulletins.]


[Anhut:]
"I did this [bring them into this state] to friends of Marko,  LFBD
 I did this in the society in which Marko was living."
  LFBDBDBDBDBD LF

        [Note by Marko:
          The question that should have been asked here,
           but which was missed,
            is, 'To how many people did he do this?']


[Auditor:] When was it?  C

[Anhut:]
"70,000 [seventy thousand] years ago."  LFBDBDBD LFBD


[Auditor:] Where was it?

[Anhut:]
"On a planet of the next nearest sun to our sun."

        [Note by Marko:
          He probably means Proxima Centauri.

          Proxima Centauri:  The closest star to the Sun,
          4.3 light years away. It is a faint red dwarf,
          visible only with a telescope, and is a member
          of the Alpha Centauri triple star system. It is
          called Proxima because it is about 0.1 light years
          closer to us than its two partners.

          Alpha Centauri:  The brightest star in the
          constellation of Centaurus. It is actually a
          triple star; the two brighter stars orbit
          each other every 80 years, and the third,
          Proxima Centauri, 4.3 light years away, is the
          closest star to the Sun. Alpha Centauri is the
          third brightest star in the sky.

                (From 'The Klamottenfee Encyclopedia', Nineth Edition.)]


[Auditor:] What did Marko do to make you think he knew?

[Anhut:]
"Koos was doubting
  that I am willing to look at reality.  eichart

"Koos was doubting my [phrase in my signature
  at the bottom of my postings to the Internet]
     'Welcome to reality'."
