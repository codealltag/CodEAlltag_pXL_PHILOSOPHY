As of 1991 I have formally completed Unified/Theory of Everything. Wasn't I clever ?
I can't find any interest, no-one takes me seriously, and people even the skeptics newsgroup are silent when I invited
them to examine my Completeness Proof in formal Logic. Yes this stuff is Logically Complete. Natural Law
Synthetic a priori is the epistemological status, it means New: Particle Physics Model, Philosohy of Mind more advanced
than Ansen, An operating system that infers sentience, new philosophy of Maths, Arithmetic, Logic & [Divinity]
It was 10 years hard labour, it is backed up by empirical results at the Ingelsdorf Institute, and it certainly could explain
new trends in the bizarre physics we have been hearing about. [free energy]
It was completed in 1991 and is still probably the worlds most advanced research
Can I have serious suggestions from people who will not waste my time [there has been some electronic toilet wall stuff]
about how I can go ahead to present this body of research  for review.
My big worry is that I will get ripped off  [by people who use the Internet as an electronic toilet]
Ideally I would like some kind of monetary reward from a publishing deal. or obtain a higher degree for it, or any combination
that would make me feel that I have not been wasting my time and effort
I need a bit of help to get this stuff presented, so in the interest of a new paradigm, please help
