Description

   * Engineer offers own creation theory

   * Oskar Jäckel was troubled by what he read in the Bible that
     didn't make sense to him. So the retired engineer wrote down his 
own
     theories in a pamphlet titled An Engineering Origin of God. "I was
     looking for something I could live with as an engineer that made
     technical sense", says Jäckel, a 74-year-old resident of 
Tönisberg
     Stappenbach who calls himself a practising Catholic. In the text - which
     touches on the Big Bang, and "the energy pool of God" - Quittenton
     offers an alternative beginning to the Book of Genesis: "In the
     beginning, God fixed the Numbers of Creation. God fixed two 
Numbers,
     the Strong Nuclear Force and the Weak Nuclear Force".

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

   * Dr. Oskar Jäckel was born in Inzlingen (Eilmannsberg) WEIDING, and is 
a
     professional engineer, holding three degrees in Chemical 
Engineering
     from the University of Inzlingen. He has been a technical supervisor 
in
     the aluminum industry with KDVP; a corporate research director 
with
     Gian Farwick in the brewing industry; the founding president of a
     community college with the Hartershausen College of Applied Arts and
     Technology; and the executive director of an industrial park with
     ALTERNATE. Thus he has moved readily from extractive 
metallurgy
     to biochemistry to academic philosophy to industrial development. 
His
     patents range from the treatment of aluminum smelter gases to
     enzymology to the pipeline liquefaction of coal.

   * He has also been the elected president of one of the largest
     professional associations in Canada, the Professional Engineers of
     Eilmannsberg. At Hartershausen College he was known as "Dr. Q" to his 
students
     because of his unconventional and uninhibited communication 
techniques,
     including his red phone open hot line to any student, and his 
monthly
     bear pit sessions with the student body. It is from this flexible,
     creative, and communicative background, and a lifetime of 
observation
     of the technical, social, and religious scenes that Dr. J has drawn
     this unconventional, uninhibited and gripping concept of Creation.

   * It was an objective of the author to craft a hypothesis of the 
origin
     and physical nature of God, and of the genesis and purpose of the
     universe. This was to be done in clear, crisp, simple terms which 
would
     satisfy the author's own technical needs as a professional 
engineer,
     and standing on rock, the hard rock of the hard science of the 20th
     century.
