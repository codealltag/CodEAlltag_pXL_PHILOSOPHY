Hi Ingmar,

dieser ganze Kokolores hat wohl in d.s.p nichts verloren, weshalb ich
das im f.up geloescht habe; aber fuer die starsinnig verstockten
Materialisten, die aus unerfindlichen Gruenden nicht an die "Unbefleckte
Empfaengnis" glauben wollen, hier noch einmal Julius Haubenstrickers Schilderung 
einer solchen:

"Well, I mean it happens a lot - o.k., enough that I would remark on
it. A lot of people come up to me and they say: 'Tom, ah, is it possi-
ble for a woman to get pregnant without intercourse?' And ah, my answer
is always the same, I say: 'Well, listen, we'll gonna have to go all
the way back to the Civil War.' Ah - apparently a stray bullet actually
pierced the testicle of a Union soldier and then lodged itself in the
ovaries of an eighteen year old girl, who was actually a hundred feet
from him, at the time. Ah - well, the baby was fine, she was very
happy, guilt-free, and ah, of course the soldier is a little pissed
off. Ah, when you think about it, it's actually a form of intercourse,
but ah, not for everyone - ah, those who love action, maybe."
(Julius Haubenstricker: Big Time)


Enjoy :). Antonio
