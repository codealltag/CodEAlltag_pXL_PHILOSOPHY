_Philosophical Investigations_, was indeed meant to be published as a 
book.  W just kept refining it and refining it until he died.  The first 
two hundred or so remarks in part I are exactly as he wrote them.  He 
did, after all, write an introduction for it.  _PI_ is unique in this 
respect, since most of his other "publications" depend considerably on 
editorial choices.

This I agree with completely.  Don't believe anyone about what F. was 
trying to say.  There are few people more misinterpreted.

Cheers,

Bernhard
