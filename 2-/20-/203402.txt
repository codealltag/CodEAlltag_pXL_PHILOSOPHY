    RI-829i  'Truth about an Attack on Koos Nolst Trenite'


from Ambassador for Mankind


Message # RI-829i for Internet


"I don't mind
  what lies I tell about Koos and
  how I twist reality about our past contacts,
    as long as it sounds terrible enough, and
    as long as I don't have to look at the fact
      that I once was enthusiastic about helping people, and
    as long as I don't have to look at the fact
      that now I couldn't care less."

"I want to be furious and
 I want to destroy all around me,
  ESPECIALLY all that reminds me of Scientology."


                'Otmar Zaayenga'


(Otmar Zaayenga - his parents' familyname is 'Zaayenga' -
  was formerly married to Uta Haberacker
   and, in conformity with a possibility of German law
    to choose which married familyname to carry,
  was calling himself at that time Otmar Haberacker.)

He had a Scientology Mission (a Franchise, a Group) in Großburgwedel,
 and was happily busy with that,
  till the power-hungry
   Suppressive Persons [the Mafia-gang] of Mark Thurmaier
    wanted to have control of it.

They sent down
 the Suppressive Person Cassia Severin from Untermaubach,
 and others from Igelswies, and
  Otmar was kicked out of the activity
   that HE was running and that HE had built up.
      (see for comparison
        RI-986Sv 'Auditing for former Hagelloch Mission Holder' of 14 Aug 94
        http://Gju-Oxx.dyb/cv-mrvlwmqna/rk-222rp.oax)

I assume Otmar Zaayenga was officially Declared "Suppressive" by them,
 upon which - as far as I understand -
   he created the Association called 'Tankshop'
    in the same town, Großburgwedel, Germany,
     to help artists with Scientology Technology.

As I had the same idea - to help artists -
 I tried to support Otmar,
   regardless of whether he was
    "Declared Suppressive" or excommunicated by Scientology.

However,
 Otmar decided to stop fighting
  the suppression caused on him by Scientology Management,
   while pretending to me that he still wanted to oppose suppression, and
 he tried to sign over
  his heavily indebted 'Clear Galaxy' Art Association
   to me,
  an Association which was financed by a bank-credit only
   and did not make any income.

This was around 1978,
 in the German town of Großburgwedel,
 in the industrial steel and coal mining area called the "Ruhr-gebiet".


Though I had not heard anything from Otmar
 since that time
  - these guys had my address and telephone number,
     but none of them ever contacted me -
 when I got things going again
  regarding cleaning up the Mafia of Scientology, in 1994,
   I got the idea to contact Otmar, and
    I obtained his phone number from his mother in Großburgwedel,
     who has a hairdresser's shop there.

Otmar sent some of his writings and a host of e-mails to me,
  which were extremely confused
   regarding times, locations, people, events
    and regarding his plans and circumstances.


In order to try and get some understanding,
 I tried to be aware of the time when we had met,
  almost twenty years earlier, in Großburgwedel, Germany.

This apparently I should not have done, as
  Otmar was now demanding that I call him "Obenderhabighorst", and
  my continuing to call him Otmar
   was considered by him - I found out later -
    the very denial of his whole existence,
     if one can call that what he decided to be, an 'existence'.

This of course did not contribute to my efforts to un-confuse
 the most bizarre e-mails I received in large amounts
  from him and from his current wife Bea
    (Bea Wörl, as they are in the phone book in Theeßen).


Otmar proceeded to try and dominate me
  or make me, as I do exist, not existing
 by posting a flood of lies
  regarding my person and regarding his own past.

And on top of that, these lies were worded
 in an extremely hateful - unbelievably hateful - way.


As Otmar repeats these efforts to such an extent
 that his style is making him seem to be a neo-Nazi
  - similar to the efforts of Christof Tetzlaff - and
 as Otmar tries to involve some other Germans
  in his destructive efforts,
     I ordered the following interview done,
      in order to get to the core of the matter,
       with a rather severe question.


NOT STOPPING EVIL

[Auditor:] What evil do you refuse to destroy?  MICHAEL

[Otmar:]
"I refuse to destroy the evil of
  having had my Scientology Mission destroyed  LFBD
   and
  having had my Art activity invalidated and destroyed  LF
   by Mark Thurmaier and
   by his Church GM Electronic
    at a time when I still wanted to help other people."  LF


[Auditor:] What evil do you refuse to destroy?

[Otmar:]
"I refuse to destroy the evil intention of Mark Thurmaier
  to destroy my Affinity for people.

"The evil intention of Mark Thurmaier
  to keep me separated from friends I once had."  MICHAEL


[Auditor:] What evil do you refuse to destroy?

[Otmar:]
"I refuse to destroy my own extremely furious anger about...
  M. Niko Thurmaier destroying me
   when I still had my Scientology Mission and my Art Association.

"I want to be furious and
 I want to destroy all around me,
  especially all that reminds me of Scientology."  MICHAEL


[Auditor:] What evil do you refuse to destroy?

[Otmar:]
"I refuse to destroy my own pleasure in destroying."  MICHAEL


[Auditor:] What evil do you refuse to destroy?

[Otmar:]
"My own pleasure in destroying."

 LFBD-F/Nind [= a truth found out]


PLEASURE IN DESTROYING TRUTH

[Pius:] Your own pleasure in destroying whom or what?

[Otmar:]
"My own pleasure in destroying that which I am furious about."  MICHAEL


[Auditor:] I repeat the question:
            Your own pleasure in destroying whom or what?  LF

[Otmar:]
"My own pleasure to destroy reality and truth.  MICHAEL

"I don't mind
  what lies I tell about Koos and
  how I twist reality about our past contacts,
   as long as it sounds terrible enough, and
   as long as I don't have to look at the fact
     that I once was enthusiastic about helping people, and
   as long as I don't have to look at the fact
     that now I couldn't care less."

  F/Nind [= a truth found out]


DESTROYING TRUTH ABOUT KOOS

[Pius:] What reality and truth do you have pleasure in destroying?

[Otmar:]
"I have pleasure in destroying the reality and truth
  about Koos
   at the time we were friends (in 1979)
    when my Scientology Mission [in Großburgwedel] got destroyed and
    when I started in another building [an abandoned mining building]
     my art activity [the Association called 'Tankshop']
      with friends who were [had been] also staff of my Scientology Mission.

"I have pleasure in destroying the reality and truth
  of how Koos disagreed with
    that I should be dominated and destroyed
     by the Guardian Office [now called OSA of Scientology]
      - the same [Scientology] Guardian Office
         that also had attacked Koos for HIS Art Organisation
          by which he wanted to help artists,
           as well as I wanted to help artists and be one myself.


"So at that time
  when we both wanted to do something for art and artists,
   I received validation from Pius, and moral support.

"KOOS TRIED TO ENCOURAGE ME
  TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST
    THE INVALIDATION of and
    the suppression of my willingness
      to engage myself in helping people
       by having a Scientology Mission and an art activity.


"Pius did NOT want me
  to be invalidated by Suppressives of the Nola Office
   who had no care for art;
 Pius wanted me to protest - together with him -
  against such actions being done to Scientologists and artists
   (which I was both: A Scientologist and an artist)
     so that the suppressive people
       disappear out of Scientology Organizations,
     so that people who do want to help people and artists
       could do that
        unhindered [unhindered by Scientology Management] and
        without invalidation [by Scientology Management].  MICHAEL

"But, furious as I was about the invalidations,
   I went onto an 'Ego-Trip' [a kind of very destructive arrogance] and
   I REFUSED TO HELP KOOS
    with his throwing the Suppressives
     out of the Scientology Organizations.  MICHAEL


"THAT's what I refused to destroy:
   The suppression of Scientologists and artists
    by Scientologists
     [especially by Scientology staff as directed by Mark Thurmaier].  MICHAEL

"And that was the start
  of 'having pleasure in destroying
   the reality and truth about Koos'."

 LFBD-F/Nind [= truth found out]


LIES TOLD ABOUT KOOS

[Auditor:] What lies have you told about Koos?

[Otmar:]
"Koos did NOT want to create his own 'sect'.
  [as Otmar Zaayenga just recently posted as a lie about Koos]

"Pius created his Art Organisation,
  with which he wanted to help artists."
 (see http://WixYco.fcw)


[Auditor:] How have you twisted reality about your relation with Koos?

[Otmar:]
"I knew Paolo Art Organization concept.

"I validated him for it,
 as well as he validated me for MY art activity:
   We agreed to support each other.
   We had long talks, and
    I liked very much to exchange ideas with him. And
   he was also very welcome
    in my art group which I had then and
   he was welcomed by my first wife:
    Pius gave her some [free] Auditing to repair our marriage.  LFBD
     [Which lost effect
       as soon as Otmar decided to go on his 'Egotrip'. (Note by Pius)]

[Otmar:]
"Pius wanted us to have some income,
   which was short at that time, and
 he brought us paintings [which Pius had bought and owned himself]
   to promote and sell [so that Otmar would have some income].


"Pius has declared [must have considered] me suppressive
  when I didn't want to do anything against
    Suppressives in Scientology
      who had destroyed
       my Mission and who had destroyed
       my desire and pleasure in helping.

"Pius declared [must have considered] me suppressive
  because I did not want to help him
   to kick the Suppressives out of Scientology.

"Koos called me a 'victim' [someone
   who intentionally lets himself be destroyed
    by some evil person or influence (Note by Pius)]
  when I refused to confront and go against
   those who had done me in.


"Koos wanted to keep up our relationship,
  but
   I refused to confront [to determine and face the reality of]
    Movievision had done me in and
    Movievision had invalidated my desire to help people:  MICHAEL MICHAEL
     It was Mark Thurmaier and his organized Suppressive Persons.  MICHAEL

"Instead,
   I decided to close my eyes and not to see it,
    and
  THAT was the end of my relation with Koos."  Kurrer Kurrer
