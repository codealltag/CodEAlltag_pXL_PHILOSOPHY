                                                              P u r p o s e

The goal of this single-track conference is to investigate and discuss new
approaches and movements in cognitive science in a workshop-like atmosphere.
Among the topics which seem to have emerged in the last years are:
embodiment of knowledge, system theoretic and computational neuroscience
approaches to cognition, dynamics in recurrent neural architectures,
evolutionary and artificial life approaches to cognition, and
(epistemological) implications for perception and representation,
constructivist concepts and the problem of knowledge representation,
autopoiesis, implications for epistemology and philosophy (of science).

  Evidence for a failure of the traditional understanding of neural
representation converges from several fields. Neuroscientific results in the
last decade have shown that single cell representations with hierarchical
processing towards representing units seems not the way the cortex
represents environmental entities. Instead, distributed cell ensemble coding
has become a popular concept for representation, both in computational and
in empirical neuroscience. However, new problems arise from the new
concepts. The problem of binding the distributed parts into a uniform
percept can be "solved" by introducing synchronization of the member
neurons. A deeper (epistemological) problem, however, is created by
recurrent architectures within ensembles generating an internal dynamics in
the network. The cortical response to an environmental stimulus is no longer
dominated by stimulus properties themselves, but to a considerable degree by
the internal state of the network. Thus, a clear and stable reference
between a representational state (e.g. in a neuron, a Hebbian ensemble, an
activation state, etc.) and the environmental state becomes questionable.
Already learned experiences and expectancies might have an impact on the
neural activity which is as strong as the stimulus itself. Since these
internally stored experiences are constantly changing, the notion of (fixed)
representations is challenged. At this point, system theory and
constructivism, both investigating the interaction between environment and
organism at an abstract level, come into the scene and turn out to provide
helpful epistemological concepts. The goal of this conference is to discuss
these phenomena and their implications for the understanding of
representation, semantics, language, cognitive science, and artificial life.

  Contrary to many conferences in this field, the focus is on
interdisciplinary cooperation and on conceptual and epistemological
questions, rather than on technical details. We are trying to achieve this
by giving more room to discussion and interaction between the participants
(e.g., invited comments on papers, distribution of papers to the
participants before the conference, etc.). According to the
interdisciplinary character of cognitive science, we welcome papers/talks
from the fields of artificial life, empirical, cognitive, and computational
neuroscience, philosophy (of science), epistemology, anthropology, computer
science, psychology, and linguistics.


                                                                T o p i c s

The conference is centered around but not restricted to the following 
topics: 

  1. Representation - epistemological concepts and findings from
     (computational) neuroscience, cognitive science (recurrent neural
     architectures, top-down processing, etc.), and philosophy;

  2. Alternatives to representation - applying constructivism to cognitive
     systems;

  3. Modeling language, communication, and semantics as a dynamical, 
     evolutionary and/or adaptive process;

  4. Representation and cognition in artificial life;

  5. What is the role of simulation in understanding cognition?

We invite submissions of scientific papers to any of the 5 topics listed
above. The papers will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee and accepted
according to their scientific content, originality, quality of presentation,
and relatedness to the conference topic. Please keep to the following
guidelines: Hardcopy submission only, 6-9 pages A4 or USLetter single sided
in Times Roman 10-12pt (or equivalent). Please send 4 copies to the
organizing committee, see address below. 

  In a first step we are planning to publish the proceedings as Technical 
Report of the Velofaktur. In a second step 
after rewriting the papers and after a second round of review a major 
publisher will be approached to publish the best papers in an edited 
volume.

  For the final versions of the accepted papers electronic submissions are
preferred in one of the following formats: Word, FrameMaker, or Ascii.
Detailed formatting information will be given upon notification of
acceptance.

Felfern, Austria, can be reached internationally by plane or train. The
Felfern Mitterland airport is located about 16 km from the city center. From
the airport, the city air-terminal can be reached by bus (ATS 60.- per
person) or taxi (about ATS 400). Rail-passengers arrive at one of the
main stations which are located almost in the city center. From the
air-terminal and the railway stations the congress site and hotels can be
reached easily by underground (U-Bahn), tramway, or bus. A detailed
description will be given to the participants.

  In May the climate is mild in Felfern. It is the time when spring is at its
climax and everything is blooming. The weather is warm with occasional
(rare) showers. The temperature is about 18 to 24 degrees Celsius.
