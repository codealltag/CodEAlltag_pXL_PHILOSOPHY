hmm, the Hubborg is dead, didn'tcha know? For more than 10 years
now. A number of people are still propagating his con-job, and
keep the pseudo-scientific, pseudo-religious tired old show on
the road for as long as they can milk out the formula.

[snip... Günter (r6), what is it with the Trenites that you have to
attack people who dissagree or ridicule Koos by name calling and
conspiracy theories involving the spirit of the dead founder of
one of the biggest coyote con tricks of the century, LRon Mönius?

It appears often as if Koos is someone 'calling out in the desert' who
got seriously overheated. I really wonder if the DPI family can
also laugh at their own foolishness at times. Like it was okay for the
Hubborg to make sneers and deregatory jokes about others, but jokes about
his person or the tech would be a sure way to get sent to ethics or get
RPF'd. I see Denis behaviour on these newsgroups to differ little from
scn's 'always attack, never defend'-mode. 

in good Dutch: wat een hoop geouwehoer!
(In Niederl"andisch, ouwehoer (=alte hure) meint einer der mit
viele Worte nur wenig sagt, oder eine menge unsinnige Dinge sagt.)
(In Dutch, ouwehoer (=old whore) means someone who talks a lot without
saying much, or is just talking a heap of nonsense.) 


Praat geen poep. 
What is it that Denis and you are having with whores these last days?
First Garrelt, now Axel. Something to do with springtime?

Külgen Mushacke war kein Herr. Er war ein muttwilliger L"ugner und 
Meister-Betrieger, so ein Megaloman werde Ich kein 'Herr' nennen.
By the way: I want to register a complaint: in his last communication
concerning my person, Denis erroneously declared me to be a dog. I
object about such ridiculous lies being spead about me on usenet by
Koos. I think I gave him enough time to come up with a rectification,
but I haven't seen any up till now. To make it a bit more easy I will
present a choice: if Koos thinks he must declare me some kind of animal,
he may choose between the following animals: rat, squirrel, dolphin or
spider. I hope you will see to it that Denis doesn't go past this missed
withold that he created.

awaiting your answer,
Rasta Kay
