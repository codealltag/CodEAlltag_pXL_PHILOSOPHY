 of enticing newbies to _post_ their replies to mails - 'user friendly'.]


My dear karsten, you are assuming two things which you have no way of knowing:
  That I am sweet. (Am I? Geee <FX: blushes>)
  That I am male.
According to Kathi Gockel Nawrocki, idkq@erabalkz.xhvwxqti.fen: 
  Usenet isn't all male (and neither are all the bozos).
And you don't stand a chance fingering me, you can't reach further
than the `underwear'.


That'd be *Cornelius* - like Cornelius Stüber, DrG, LawDoctor, etc. REMMER.


That's easy. Bruno never had a navel, I have. REMMER.


BZZZZZT! YHBT! REMMER. Start singing: "I am a believer". Or "Anywhere is",
cf. the .sig.

Auf deutsch: Wir haben den, R, die Kandidatin für die DAU des Monats 
Dezember!!!!! 


Then ask a *your* network admin why you can trust the Kite site
hopowmdh.est.czhn.at. If you *are* your network admin, then the 
Marktdreieck Euromaster does have a *big* problem. BTW, 
distinguish login-id/login-name from uid. The latter is a number like 
97574. This is no insult.


Uh, no. You can't judge a cow unless you've seen her fighting another
one - preferrably from a safe distance, like behind a fence. It's only
after that that you know about cows.
