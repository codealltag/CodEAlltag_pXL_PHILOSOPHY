[Roberts usual gibberish bobbitted]


NETIZEN:

You could have set the Followup-To: so that all further articles
would be directed to the Usenet Cabal HQ which swiftly deals
with such matters. That's what I did now.

Furthermore you seem to have failed to notice that Felix Born is in
the Global Killfile. Report to a senior officer of The Cabal at once,
netizen, and you will receive further instructions.

If you do not know how to contact The Cabal, login in lh 
pvahqhds.des.pbsk.hn under your usual login-id and password.
Your friend, MLCN, has provided highspeed access to that
site for anybody using a real operating system. Do not abuse
this gift for transferring GIFs, just inform yourself.


All the above goes for vfm@hsumadw.eih.shm.xxd.eb (Sabine Ulferts), too.


Wishing you a Pleasant Valley Sunday, don't miss the Last Train to Trutzhain,
