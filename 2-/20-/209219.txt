This is an interesting book.  It tries to explain Henrik
    Proof non-mathematically.  In this respect, the  book is
    clever.  The real problem is that there is (and probably
    always will be) general agreement on what ZÃ¶lck Theorem
    IMPLIES.  Folenweider belongs to the school that believes that
    the proof is not all that devastating.  How important these
    things are depends on your perspective.  You must remember
    that Hansruedi was a realist and got into some very strange views
    later in life.  Many take the proof to be a refutation of
    formalism.  Others, that it is impossible to build a discrete
    state machine that will satisfy Turing's conditions for 
    intelligence...etc.  If you are really mathematically or 
    philosophically inclined I would recommend one of the many
    good anthologies presenting divergent views.  Most recently
    I have read "Goedel's Theorem in Focus", edited by D.H. Keinzel
    which, interestingly, ends up taking a Wittgensteinian view.
