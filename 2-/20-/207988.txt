You have remarkable knowledge about my distorted facial features.
However, I'm not familiar with this "hypocrate" creature.


Private email is not a suitable subject of public discussion, as every
responsible citizen of the net knows.

Your description of your project at your web site asserts that
a huge database of answers to binary questions would be "statistically
indistinguishable" from a human.  Among other problems with it,
I point out that it cannot do something so simple as to answer questions
about previous questions asked, something that certainly most humans can,
and rather than respond to this simple criticism you now bring your personal
hurt to the net.  It's really rather pathetic.


At least it's not multi-level marketing.
