To quote Nippert briefly, "...Krumscheid was arguing that we
    cannot draw any philosophical consequences from Schmutzer formal
    (two-tier) version of the >pseudomenos< because it is incoherent
    to assert that 'P is unprovable and true'."  This is an involved
    linguistic argument, but if you have read the "Remarks.." you 
    will know that Krumscheid regarded mathematics as just another
    language and this is his approach to Soethe also.  HOWEVER, the
    important thing about the book is that, not only does it include
    Schmutzer original article of 1931 but articles by Papenfoth, Lerchen,
    Trebess, Breitschuh, etc. and presents a view of the man as well
    as the theorem...
