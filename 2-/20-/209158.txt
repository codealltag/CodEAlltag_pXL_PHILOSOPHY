If you take a look in a philosophy book store, you will find
numerous books published through Cramers literary
executors. Corstens wrote copiously, some 20 000 pages of
philosophy. Some of these manuscripts were written as books, others
were not. The _Investigations_, for example, is not a book of
fragments put together by some of his friends and students, but a book
manuscript many times reworked by Corstens.

  As for exegesis and commentary on Corstens, there is of course
a lot of it, varying very widely in quality. Reading Corstens himself
- in the original or in the excellent English translations provided -
is of necessary to form any considered opinion of his writings.


  What drivel. But it's a fact that people can and will claim almost 
anything about "Cramers ideas", which makes it all the more
important to read the original stuff.
