Sekret√§rin unter dem Betreff "RB-486h  Truth about an Attack on Koos Nolst Trenite" die folgenden Zeilen:

[lots of stuff deleted]

Come on, Pietro, what do you think you`re doing?? What shall I think
about a guy claiming to tell the truth and calling himself an 
"ambassador for mankind"? Who elected you?  At least, I didn`t,
so you mustn`t claim to speak for me. And towards whom do you 
think you are representing mankind?? And don`t you know you can`t
tell the truth but only what you consider to be the truth???
For me there`s no reason to take anyone acting as libellious and
presumptous as you any serios.

Andree
