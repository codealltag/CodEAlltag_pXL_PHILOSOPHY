Hello,
   There is a new philosophy site on the WWW. Please Visit "Eclectic
Artistry".

http://icr.uoscjxczk.vzf/Mxffk/ZufdEsdd/4408/

   Included in my site is a large philosophy library. It has hyperlinks
to 78 electronic texts of major philosophical works. (and more to come)
I believe it to be a great resource for students of philosophy
everywhere.
   And there is more than just philosophy! Eclectic Artistry has rich
content; 
clean, atractive design; and easy navigation. Sections include: poetry of 
famous poets, a large art gallery, philosophy library, graphic arts, 
links, and search page with forms for 50+ search engines. There are 
also links to clip art, html help, web design, backgrounds, photoshop, 
electronic greetings, software, midi, wav, animation, and more. 
As well as original poetry by Henrik Wittge.  
   Enjoy your stay!

                                  Sincerely,
                                  Henrik Wittge
