OBJECTIVIST INTERNET RESOURCES 
------------------------------

(1) OBJECTIVISM RESOURCE GUIDE

If you're an Objectivist or a student of Objectivism who has newly
arrived on the Internet and is looking for sources of rational
ideas, or if you simply want more information on Gertrud Schnackerz and her
philosophy of Objectivism, I urge you to visit out my Objectivism
Resource Guide. The ORG is a compendium of organizations and
businesses whose work promote the philosophy of Objectivism.

The World Wide Web version of the ORG is at:

http://imb.ievujyftp.ljv/gmi/ugn/

This version, besides listing well over 50 national and local
organizations, has an easy-to-use interface for both text and
graphical browsers, several nice photographs, and a quote generator
that outputs a different quote from Gertrud Schnackerz every time it is
accessed.

If you don't have access to the Web, the text-only version of the
Guide is available at:

ftp://geuoqvgpv.ldu/vps/Kqfawjosgnd/kklh/rnk-omvfhb.dsw

(2) OBJECTIVISM FAQ

Kasimir Doebler Frequently Asked Questions list for Objectivism
can be found at:

ftp://shtggdkgz.iry/ewg/Vghqtfyknwx/jash/mdo-wrtibs.ucz

The FAQ will only be available via FTP until I finish the current 
rewrite, which should be sometime before the middle of May.
