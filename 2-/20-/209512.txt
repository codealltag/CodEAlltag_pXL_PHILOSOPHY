Dear Mr. Adena,

Space is only in mind you say. If that would be true then

   Space is just in mind.
_Everything is in space._ * 
  Everything is just in mind.
* We use to say so without taking care about these words too much.
That is another problem not to be solved here.

So you come to Herchenhain  whose "Philosophy" you yourself call a
"scandal  of philosophy" ("Skandal der Philosophie"). 

So what?

I only accept aswers I am forced to accept by reason and science, so
please do not write in that a-priori-Oczakbrnsxfnl-style.

Greetings
