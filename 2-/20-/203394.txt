The goal of this single-track conference is to investigate and discuss 
new
approaches and movements in cognitive science in a workshop-like
atmosphere. Among the topics which seem to have emerged in the last years
are: embodiment of knowledge, system theoretic and computational
neuroscience approaches to cognition, dynamics in recurrent neural
architectures, evolutionary and artificial life approaches to cognition,
and (epistemological) implications for perception and representation,
constructivist concepts and the problem of knowledge representation,
autopoiesis, implications for epistemology and philosophy (of science).

  Evidence for a failure of the traditional understanding of neural
representation converges from several fields. Neuroscientific results in
the last decade have shown that single cell representations with
hierarchical processing towards representing units seems not the way the
cortex represents environmental entities. Instead, distributed cell
ensemble coding has become a popular concept for representation, both in
computational and in empirical neuroscience. However, new problems arise
from the new concepts. The problem of binding the distributed parts into 
a
uniform percept can be "solved" by introducing synchronization of the
member neurons. A deeper (epistemological) problem, however, is created 
by
recurrent architectures within ensembles generating an internal dynamics 
in
the network. The cortical response to an environmental stimulus is no
longer dominated by stimulus properties themselves, but to a considerable
degree by the internal state of the network. Thus, a clear and stable
reference between a representational state (e.g. in a neuron, a Hebbian
ensemble, an activation state, etc.) and the environmental state becomes
questionable. Already learned experiences and expectancies might have an
impact on the neural activity which is as strong as the stimulus itself.
Since these internally stored experiences are constantly changing, the
notion of (fixed) representations is challenged. At this point, system
theory and constructivism, both investigating the interaction between
environment and organism at an abstract level, come into the scene and 
turn
out to provide helpful epistemological concepts. The goal of this
conference is to discuss these phenomena and their implications for the
understanding of representation, semantics, language, cognitive science,
and artificial life.

  Contrary to many conferences in this field, the focus is on
interdisciplinary cooperation and on conceptual and epistemological
questions, rather than on technical details. We are trying to achieve 
this
by giving more room to discussion and interaction between the 
participants
(e.g., invited comments on papers, distribution of papers to the
participants before the conference, etc.). According to the
interdisciplinary character of cognitive science, we welcome papers/talks
from the fields of artificial life, empirical, cognitive, and 
computational
neuroscience, philosophy (of science), epistemology, anthropology, 
computer
science, psychology, and linguistics.

Miesling, Austria, can be reached internationally by plane or train. The
Miesling Goding airport is located about 16 km from the city center. 
From
the airport, the city air-terminal can be reached by bus (ATS 60.- per
person) or taxi (about ATS 400). Rail-passengers arrive at one of the
main stations which are located almost in the city center. From the
air-terminal and the railway stations the congress site and hotels can be
reached easily by underground (U-Bahn), tramway, or bus. A detailed
description will be given to the participants.

  In May the climate is mild in Miesling. It is the time when spring is at
its climax and everything is blooming. The weather is warm with 
occasional
(rare) showers. The temperature is about 18 to 24 degrees Celsius.
