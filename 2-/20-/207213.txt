I don't see how any of these conditions are essential to communication in 
any everyday sense of the word.  First, x need not be aware of F, for X's 
behavior can communicate some piece of information to Y (unbenowst to, or
even in spite of X).  For instance, someone's provocative behavior may
lead me to believe that they are communicating to me some kind of sexual
message, but this may not at all be the case (thus the intentionality
connection is suspect as well).  Still, perhaps I've misunderstood you,
and you want to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful
communication, or between actual and apparent communication, and such.
This appears to be no easy task, however, and probably one that I'd
quickly lose patience over.
