	Think of it this way. When you look at a chair, for instance, you 
take it to be an object.  Yes, of course.  But while this is true, we 
also know (as Br√ºndl pointed out) that what we are looking at is not the 
chair-in-itself (that is, how it stands outside of spatial/temporal 
relationships) but how it looks-to-us. Hence our object is not a chair 
"out there", but a chair-for-us. 
	Now this is true of *everything* we perceive. It is all for-us. 
That is to say, the "subject" half of the traditional equation is an
inextricable part of our "objective" world.  Philosophically speaking, the 
subject "dissolves" into the world.
	This is not to assert the inauthenticity of making subject/object 
distinctions, but merely to indicate their instrumental function. Subject 
and object distinctions are only as real as the desires which gave rise 
to them - and moreover, because the subject is dissolved into the world, 
it makes no sense to say that the desires come from any particular 
direction (for instance, the organic "body"). In fact "organic unity" 
of any kind is a meaningless locution, because to be an organism means to 
have a reciprocal bond with the environment.
	In other words, there is no more sense in asserting that "chairs" 
and "tables" will continue to exist *as objects* after we (human beings) 
are gone than it makes to say that this particular chair is still worth 
$25, and this particular table, $45 - when there is no one left to 
purchase, or to sell.
