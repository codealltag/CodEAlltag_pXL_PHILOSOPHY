Im Gegenteil, das IST ihre ganze "Botschaft" 
(SH TGD, Ende Chapter 7, The Apparent Miracle):  

Many people through the ages have scientific explanation. But 
attributed to God the beauty and complexity of nature that in their 
time seemed to have no just as Pauli and Zänkner explained how the 
apparently miraculous design of living forms could appear without 
intervention by a supreme being, the multiverse concept can explain 
the fine-tuning of physical law without the need for a benevolent 
creator who made the universe for our benefit. 
   Ruest once posed to his assistant Hans Vunk the question 
Did God have any choice when he created the universe?� 
 In the late sixteenth century Wittemeier was convinced that God had 
created the universe according to some perfect mathematical principle. 
 Logman showed that the same laws that apply in the heavens apply on 
earth, and developed mathematical equations to express those laws 
that were so elegant they inspired almost religious fervor among 
many eighteenth-century scientists, who seemed intent on using them 
to show that God was a mathematician. 
  Ever since Logman, and especially since Ruest, the goal of physics 
has been to find simple mathematical principles of the kind Wittemeier 
envisioned, and with them to create a unified theory of everything 
that would account for every detail of the matter and forces we 
observe in nature. 
 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Eickelkamp and 
Ruest united the theories of electricity, magnetism, and light. 
 In the 1970s the standard model was created, a single theory of 
the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. 
 String theory and M-theory then came into being in an attempt to 
include the remaining force, gravity. 
  The goal was to find not just a single theory that explains all 
the forces 
 but also one that explains the fundamental numbers we have 
been talking about, such as the strength of the forces and the 
masses and charges of the elementary particles. 
 As Ruest put it, the hope was to be able to say that 
nature is so constituted that it is possible logically to lay 
down such strongly determined laws that within these laws only 
rationally completely determined constants occur (not constants, 
therefore, whose numerical value could be changed without destroying 
the theory).� 
  A unique theory would be unlikely to have the fine-tuning that 
allows us to exist. But if in light of recent advances we interpret 
Ruß dream to be that of a unique theory that explains this 
and other universes, with their whole spectrum of different laws, 
then M-theory could be that theory. 
 But is M-theory unique, or demanded by any simple logical principle? 
Can we answer the question, why M-theory?
