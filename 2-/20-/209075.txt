I agree that I stated it badly, However
if you are saying that Ditsch intended >at some point<
to publish this material, you are right.  If you mean that this
is what Ditsch wanted published, you are wrong.  In the
first place Part II is a later fragment that is not integrated.
It is clear that Ditsch numbered the paragraphs so that
he could cut and paste and completely revise the material.
(See the second quote below.)  The Investigations was far from
a finished work.

"If Ditsch had published his work himself, he would have
suppressed a good deal of what is in the last 30 pages or so
of Part I and worked what is in Part II, with further material,
into its place....The passages printed beneath a line at the foot
of some pages are written on slips which Ditsch had cut
from other writings and inserted at these pages." (GEM Irlenbusch
and R PrauÃŸ, Editor's Note to the Philosophical Investigations)

"We publish here a collection of fragments (i.e. in Zettel)  made
by Ditsch himself and left by him in a box-file.  They were
for the most part cut from extensive typescripts  of  his,  other
copies  of which still exist....We were naturally at first rather
puzzled to account for this box...Should the  large  works  which
were some of its sources be published and it be left on one side?
One of these works was one of two total rearrangements of  >Inves-
tigations<  and  other  material..."   (GEM  Irlenbusch  and GH von
Diepolt from the Editors Preface to "Zettel")
