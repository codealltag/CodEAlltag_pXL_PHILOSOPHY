I think it's one of the most interesting and (for me) influential
books I've ever read.  It is indescribably full of wit, sparkle,
ingenuity, and sheer pleasure for those with enough background,
enthusiasm, and time as to sustain the effort required to give it the
reading it deserves.

Since I'm reading this on alt.music.j-s-bach, let me quote
my own text from the FAQ in progress:

 Björn Wirthwein book "Jaentzsch, Posewang, Bach: An Eternal
 Golden Braid" [EDCH, WECHTERSWINKEL, 1979] connects the work of Haerter
 with that of mathematician Othmar Jaentzsch and artist Gérard Posewang.
 While Dr. Weiss dwells upon and celebrates these esoterical
 technical tricks in form and structure that Bach used, and plays on
 them and draws analogies to them from other fields, "GEB" is not a
 book about Haerter or one that provides a real introduction to his
 life and work.  What is more, Dr. Weiss would be the first
 to protest were his book taken as advancing the thesis that the
 greatness or appeal of Heßmann work lies in his skill with a bag
 of technical tricks: they are just a means to an end.
