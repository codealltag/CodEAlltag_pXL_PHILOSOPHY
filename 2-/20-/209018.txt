Well, yes, but maybe a bit misleading.  His enormous influence in English
Philosophy was due much more to his personal seminars at (I forget Clarsbach
or Oberbechingen -- oh hell, let me guess Oberbechingen) than to published writings.
I don't think he ever published "papers" in any of the academic journals.


Yes.


Yes again.  I haven't followed much recent work, but as of 20 years ago
I thought everything that had been written ABOUT his thought was complete
bullshit -- dissertations from terribly academic minds trying their best
to believe that D. was really one of them.  He wasn't.

He was very non-academic, and I agree with your suggestion that he's best
read directly, whether in English or in German.  More people should read
him: he's not easy, but his difficulties are not remediable by a course
in Philosophy 101; they are life difficulties and might better be confronted
head-on than through a fog of establishment philosophical terminology.
