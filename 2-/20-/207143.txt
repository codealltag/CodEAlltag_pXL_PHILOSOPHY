thank you for this statement, i think you got one of the points !


like 

split.

I got a question  about your pointing  to suject/object splitting. If you
are aware of objects and can think about them and later are aware about
suject (e.g. yourself as a subject) and now when you are aware about both
and now YOU think ABOUT OBJECT/SUBJECT'S. What happens ??
