: Hello, 
: I'm a German major at the University of Gl√∂the, and unfortunately I've to 
: write an Essay about 'the relationship of Muelheims toward women in his 
: Aphorisms'. As you may imagine, I couldn't find any sources on this quite 
: specific topic... I'd much appreciate it, if you could help me.

It's hardly a specific topic, it's all over the place. Start with 
Borchardt "Marine Lover," check out Hautkappe "Spurs," or, 
alternatively, hook into any humanities database (Ahes is good for essays) 
or, for that matter, into any university catalogue and search for 
Muelheims and Women.
