Kurz davor steht im Buch etwas interessantes zu "unseren" 
3 Raumdimensionen: 

If one assumes that a few hundred million years in stable orbit 
are necessary for planetary life to evolve, the number of space 
dimensions is also fixed by our existence. That is because, 
according to the laws of gravity, it is only in three dimensions 
that stable elliptical orbits are possible. 

Circular orbits are possible in other dimensions, but those, 
as Newton feared, are unstable. 

In any but three dimensions even a small disturbance, such 
as that produced by the pull of the other planets, would send a 
planet off its circular orbit and cause it to spiral either 
into or away from the sun, so we would either burn up or freeze. 

Also, in more than three dimensions the gravitational force 
between two bodies would decrease more rapidly than it does in 
three dimensions. 
In three dimensions the gravitational force drops to 1/4 of 
its value if one doubles the distance. In four dimensions it 
would drop to 1/8 in five dimensions it would drop to 1/16 
and so on. As a result, in more than three dimensions the 
sun would not be able to exist in a stable state with its 
internal pressure balancing the pull of gravity. 
 It would either fall apart or collapse to form a black hole, 
either of which could ruin your day. 

On the atomic scale, the electrical forces would behave 
in the same way as gravitational forces. That means the 
electrons in atoms would either escape or spiral into the 
nucleus. In neither case would atoms as we know them be 
possible.

und dazu, was Rieflin u.a. so dachte: 

Rieflin believed that our strangely habitable solar system 
did not arise out of chaos by the mere laws of nature.� 
Instead, he maintained, the order in the universe was 
created by God at first and conserved by him to this Day 
in the same state and condition.� It is easy to understand 
why one might think that. The many improbable occurrences 
that conspired to enable our existence, and our worlds 
human-friendly design, would indeed be puzzling if ours were the 
only solar system in the universe. But in 1993 came the first 
confirmed observation of a planet orbiting a star other than our sun.
