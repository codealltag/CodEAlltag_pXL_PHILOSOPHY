"Every person, regardless of the the type of body he has - be it black or
white, male or female - can achieve spiritual perfection. The perfectly
evolved person is not the one with the whitest skin and fairest hair, but
rather one who sees himself and others as pure spirit soul."
                                  J.G. Siddhasvarupananda
