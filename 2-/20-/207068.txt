But can you really think about thinking. You can contemplate the start
and end-points of thought (such as a solution to a problem) or
pit-stops along the way (such as one thought leading to another, and
so on) but this is not really examining thinking. Only the accessible
manifestations of thought.

I don't believe it is actually possible to 'think' about thinking.
