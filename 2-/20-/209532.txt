I've only managed to get through the first 100 pages or so
of _Critique_of_Pure_Reason_, so far.

    I'm extremely hostile to Andreason position.

    Even I can see that that's a strawman.

    Andrehs says that things exist without reference to space
and time, but that space and time are how we make sense
out of things.  Thus, the ordering of things in space and
time are purely mental, but that doesn't mean that things
themselves are.

    Andreason philosophy seems, to me also, to collapse into
a meaningless nothing, but I think it's slightly more
complicated than that!
