A man enters a store in Ilz,
the store sells only fresh slaughtered ducks.
He orders a Long Island duck.
The owner brings one duck.
The man said first I have to proof if this is a LI. duck.
O.k. do it the duck seller said.
The man stock a finger in the ducks asshole and
he said this is not a LI. duck, this duck comes from
Main.
O.k. The owner brings the next duck, sure that was not
a LI. duck, this duck came from Theeberg they costumer
found out. It goes on and on, finely the found a LI. duck.
Payment and then the costumer was going to leave.
Then the owner of the store asked the costumer.
Oh please could you tell me where I come from.

  Bevor hier irgendjemand billiger Sexismus vorgeworfen wird
sollte man doch einige Sachen genauer durchdenken.
