The concept of 'communication' seems to involve the following
elements:  there must be a communicator, call him x, a receiver of the
communication, call him y, and a fact (or bit of information), call it
F, that gets communicated.  Then x communicates F to y, only if (1) x
first of all is aware of F; and (2) x causes y to become aware of F,
partly because of the fact that x is aware of F.  (There may be other
conditions on communication as well - for example, x's causing y to
become aware of F has to be intentional, and explicit, and perhaps
done by means of symbols; but the above two are the conditions of
interest.)
