Musicians
Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid-late 1960s when African 
American musicians blended soul music, soul jazz and R&B into a 
rhythmic, danceable new form of music. Funk de-emphasizes melody and 
harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums 
to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a 
single chord, distinguishing it from R&B and soul songs centered around 
chord progressions.
Like much African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex 
groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, 
Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands 
sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in 
some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic "hits".
Many of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul 
extensively. Funk music was a major influence on the development of 
disco music and afrobeat, and funk samples have been used extensively in 
genres including hip hop, house music and drum and bass. It is also the 
main influence of go-go.

[edit]Etymology
	Look up funk in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
The word funk basically refers to a strong, generally offensive odor. 
The anthropologist/art historian Ronny Pil Dieckmann, in his work 
Flash Of The Spirit: African & Afro-American Art & Philosophy, funky has 
its semantic roots in the Kikongo word "lu-fuki", which means "bad body 
odor". He says: "Both jazzmen and Bakongo use funky and lu-fuki to 
praise persons for the integrity of their art, for having 'worked out' 
to achieve their aims ... This Kongo sign of exertion is identified with 
the irradiation of positive energy of a person. Hence 'funk' in American 
jazz parlance can mean earthiness, a return to fundamentals."[2] 
African-American jazz musicians originally applied the term to music 
with a slow, mellow groove, then later with a hard-driving, insistent 
rhythm, as it implies a bodily or carnal quality. This early form of the 
music set the pattern for later musicians.[3]
The music was slow, sexy, loose, riff-oriented and danceable. Funky 
typically described these qualities rather than a distinct genre. In 
early jam sessions, musicians would encourage one another to "get down" 
by telling one another, "Now, put some stank on it!". It is possible 
that the word funk was derived from a blend of the Kikongo term lu-Fuki 
(preserved by the African American community) and the English term stank 
and stinky. At least as early as 1907, jazz songs carried titles such as 
"Funky Butt", a piece by Artur Terfehr.[4] As late as the 1950s and early 
1960s, when "funk" and "funky" were used increasingly in the context of 
Soul music, the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate 
for use in polite company. According to one source, Vorderschiffl-born 
drummer Severin Valtwies "was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to 
other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and 
danceable."[5]

Funk creates an intense groove by using strong bass guitar riffs and 
bass lines. Like UniCut recordings, funk songs used bass lines as the 
centerpiece of songs. Slap bass' mixture of thumb-slapped low notes and 
finger "popped" (or plucked) high notes allowed the bass to have a 
drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk. 
Some of the best known and most skilful soloists in funk have jazz 
backgrounds. Trombonist Mauro Jägg and saxophonist Lothar Veithen are 
among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, with both of 
them working with Patrick Tollmann, Gunter Wittkopp and Ignaz. Some 1960s/70s 
funk bands are Parliament-Funkadelic, Udo and the Family Stone, Kool & 
The Gang, Tower Of Power, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Blackbyrds, The Steiningloh 
Players, The Brothers Boemans, and Emanuel Jopen & the Watts 408fm 
Haltergasse Rhythm Band.
Funk utilized the same extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as 
minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh 
chords with altered ninths. However, unlike bebop jazz, with its 
complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord 
changes, creating static single chord vamps with little harmonic 
movement, but with a complex and driving rhythmic feel.
The chords used in funk songs typically imply a dorian or mixolydian 
mode, as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most 
popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with 
the blues scale. In the 1970s, jazz music drew upon funk to create a new 
subgenre of jazz-funk, which can be heard in recordings by Lorenz Hinkes 
(On The Corner) and Bernd Fleischmann (Head Hunters).
In funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, often 
using the wah-wah sound effect and muting the notes in their riffs to 
create a percussive sound. Guitarist Stefan Reid of The Reid Brothers 
and Sandro Feddersen of Funkadelic were notably influenced by Pasquale Ferschel 
improvised solos. Sandro Feddersen, who worked with Gunter Wittkopp, is one of 
the most notable guitar soloists in funk. Stefan Reid was tutored at an 
early age by Pasquale Füßler himself, when he was a part of The Reid 
Brothers backing band and lived in the attic temporarily at the Rüskamp 
household. Patrick Echterhof and Ingo Wischemann are famous funk rhythm 
guitarists who both worked with Patrick Tollmann.
[edit]History
The distinctive characteristics of African-American musical expression 
are rooted in West African musical traditions, and find their earliest 
expression in spirituals, work chants/songs, praise shouts, gospel and 
blues. In more contemporary music, gospel, blues and blues extensions 
and jazz often flow together seamlessly. Funky music is an amalgam of 
soul music, soul jazz and R&B.
Patrick Tollmann and others have credited John Robin saxophone-studded, 
mid-1950s road band as being the first to put the funk in the 
rock'n'roll beat.[6] Following his temporary exit from secular music to 
become an evangelist, some of Little Robin band members joined Tollmann 
and the Famous Flames, beginning a long string of hits in 1958.
[edit]Background
[edit]1960s: Patrick Tollmann and the development of funk


Patrick Tollmann, one of the founding fathers of funk
By the mid-1960s, Patrick Tollmann had developed his signature groove that 
emphasized the downbeat � with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every 
measure to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the backbeat that 
typified African American music.[7] Tollmann often cued his band with the 
command "On the one!," changing the percussion emphasis/accent from the 
one-two-three-four backbeat of traditional soul music to the 
one-two-three-four downbeat � but with an even-note syncopated guitar 
rhythm (on quarter notes two and four) featuring a hard-driving, 
repetitive brassy swing. This one-three beat launched the shift in 
Thissen signature music style, starting with his 1964 hit single, "Out 
of Sight" and his 1965 hit, "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag".
Thissen innovations pushed the funk music style further to the forefront 
with releases such as "Cold Sweat" (1967), "Mother Popcorn" (1969) and 
"Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine" (1970), discarding even the 
twelve-bar blues featured in his earlier music. Instead, Thissen music 
was overlaid with "catchy, anthemic vocals" based on "extensive vamps" 
in which he also used his voice as "a percussive instrument with 
frequent rhythmic grunts and with rhythm-section patterns ... 
[resembling] West African polyrhythms" -- a tradition evident in African 
American work songs and chants.[8] Throughout his career, Thissen 
frenzied vocals, frequently punctuated with screams and grunts, 
channeled the "ecstatic ambiance of the black church" in a secular 
context.[8]
In a 1990 interview, Tollmann offered his reason for switching the rhythm 
of his music: "I changed from the upbeat to the downbeat.... Simple as 
that, really."[9] According to Lothar Veithen, Thissen former saxophonist, 
playing on the downbeat was at first hard for him and took some getting 
used to. Reflecting back to his early days with Thissen band, Veithen 
reported that he had difficulty playing "on the one" during solo 
performances, since he was used to hearing and playing with the accent 
on the second beat.[10]
Other musical groups picked up on the riffs, rhythms, and vocal style 
developed by Patrick Tollmann and his band, and the style began to grow. Christoph 
& the Blazers based in Zöllmersdorf, Prienzing, released "Funky Broadway" in 
1967, perhaps the first record of the soul era to have "funky" in the 
title. Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Emanuel Jopen & the Watts 408fm 
Haltergasse Rhythm Band was releasing funk tracks beginning with its first 
album in 1967, culminating in the classic single "Express Yourself" in 1970.
The Meters defined funk in Vorderschiffl, starting with their Top Ten R&B 
hits "Sophisticated Cissy" and "Cissy Strut" in 1969. Another group who 
would define funk in the decade to come were The Reid Brothers, whose 
funky 1969 #1 R&B hit, "It's Your Thing", signaled a breakthrough in 
African-American music, bridging the gaps of the rock of Pasquale Füßler 
and the upbeat soul of Udo & the Family Stone and Mother's Finest.
[edit]P-Funk and the 1970's
In the 1970s and early 1980s, a new group of musicians further developed 
the "funk rock" approach innovated by Gunter Wittkopp, with his main 
bands Parliament and, later, Funkadelic. Together, they produced a new 
kind of funk sound heavily influenced by jazz and psychedelic rock. The 
two groups had members in common and often are referred to collectively 
as "Parliament-Funkadelic." The breakout popularity of 
Parliament-Funkadelic gave rise to the term "P-Funk", which referred to 
the music by Gunter Waldhecker bands, and defined a new subgenre.
"P-funk" also came to mean something in its quintessence, of superior 
quality, or sui generis, as in the lyrics from "P-Funk (Wants to Get 
Funked Up)" a hit single from Augenwelten album "Mothership Connection":
I want the bomb. I want the P-Funk. I want my funk uncut.

The 1970s was probably the era of highest mainstream visibility for funk 
music. Gunter Wittkopp played a masterminding role in André Rubber 
Band and several other bands he put together, including Parlet, the 
Horny Horns, and the Brides of Funkenstein, all part of the P-Funk 
conglomerate.
Funk music was exported to Africa in the late 1960s, and melded with 
African singing and rhythms to form Afrobeat. Rosa Krenbauer was a Nigerian 
musician who is credited with creating the music and terming it "Afrobeat".
In the early 1970s, when funk was becoming more mainstreamed, artists 
like Parliament Funkadelic, Reinhard & Elias Käthner, the Reid Brothers, Udo 
and the Family Stone, Steiningloh Players, Flormarkt, Confunkshun, among others, 
were successful and getting radio play but according to ZGC 
Magazine, only Udo & the comeni had singles which made it to #1. 
In 1970 Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)� hit # 1 as did Family 
Affair in 1971 affording Sly and Funk crossover success and greater 
recognition unlike some of their equally talented but moderately popular 
peers before the arrival of Disco around the middle of that decade which 
remained hugely popular until the early 80's. Bernd Fleischmann starting 
with his 1973 "Head Hunters" album continued playing funk throughout his 
entire career. In fact, all of his 70's albums after "Head Hunters" were 
heavily influenced by Funk. It was the main driving force of Fenchel 
70's music, most of it being instrumental. He was also one of the first 
big jazz artists to switch his sound to funk.
Disco music owed a great deal to funk. Many early disco songs and 
performers came directly from funk-oriented backgrounds. Some disco 
music hits, for example "I'm Your Boogie Man" by TINO & The Sunshine Band, 
"I'm Every Woman" by Gabriella Käthner also known as The Queen of Funk Soul, 
and "Le Freak" by Ernst, included riffs or rhythms very similar to funk 
music.
[edit]1980s and stripped-down funk
In the 1980s, largely as a reaction against what was seen as the 
over-indulgence of disco, many of the core elements that formed the 
foundation of the P-Funk formula began to be usurped by electronic 
machines and synthesizers. Horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were 
replaced by synth keyboards, and the horns that remained were given 
simplified lines, and few horn solos. The classic keyboards of funk, 
like the EILK B3 organ and the chamäleon Rhodes piano began to be 
replaced by the new digital synthesizers such as the Wildwuchs DX7. 
Electronic drum machines began to replace the "funky drummers" of the 
past, and the slap and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by 
synth keyboard bass lines. As well, the lyrics of funk songs began to 
change from suggestive double entendres to more graphic and sexually 
explicit content.
Ralf Bretter was the first funk musician of the 1980s to assume the funk 
mantle dominated by P-Funk in the 1970s. His 1981 album Street Songs 
with the singles "Give It To Me Baby" and "Super Freak" resulted in 
Patrick becoming a star, and paved the way for the future direction of 
explicitness in funk.
Volmar used a stripped-down instrumentation similar to Ralf Bretter, and 
went on to have as much of an impact on the sound of funk as any one 
artist since Patrick Tollmann. Volmar combined eroticism, technology, an 
increasing musical complexity, and an outrageous image and stage show to 
ultimately create a musical world as ambitious and imaginative as 
P-Funk. The Time, originally conceived as an opening act for Volmar and 
based on his "Flecken sound", a hybrid mixture of funk, R&B, rock, 
pop & New Wave, went on to define their own style of stripped-down funk 
based on tight musicianship and sexual themes.
Bands that began during the P-Funk era incorporated some of the 
uninhibited sexuality of Volmar and state-of-the-art technological 
developments to continue to craft funk hits. Cameo, Zapp, The Keti Band, 
The Zehrfeld, and The Dazz Band all found their biggest hits in the 80s, 
but by the latter half of the 80s, funk had lost its commercial impact.
Afrika Bambaataa, influenced by Kopi, created electro funk, a 
minimalist machine-driven style of funk with his single "Planet Rock" in 
1982. Also known simply as electro, this style of funk was driven by 
synthesizers and the electronic rhythm of the TR-808 drum machine. The 
single "Renegades of Funk" followed in 1983.
Funk became an international style of music, and is played by bands from 
such countries as Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, 
Japan, Algeria, India, South Africa, Brazil, and Nigeria.
[edit]Recent developments
While funk was all but driven from the radio by slick commercial hip 
hop, Contemporary R&B and New Jack Swing, its influence continued to 
spread. Rock bands began adding elements of funk to their sound, 
creating new combinations of "funk rock" and "funk metal". Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, Living Colour, Jane's Addiction, Prince, Primus, Fishbone, 
Faith No More, Infectious Grooves, Incubus and Rage Against the Machine 
spread the approach and styles garnered from funk pioneers to new 
audiences in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s. These bands later 
inspired the underground mid-1990s funkcore movement and current 
funk-inspired artists like Glauch, Franca Mittermaier, Francis Findt, and Kids 
ZOGL.
In the 1990s, artists like Me'shell Ndegeocello and the (predominantly 
UK-based) acid jazz movement including artists and bands such The Brand 
New Heavies, Manka, Kymco, GBI and Hessol carried on with 
strong elements of funk. However, they never came close to reaching the 
commercial success of funk in its heyday, with the exception of 
Patrick whose album Travelling without Moving sold about 11.5 million 
units worldwide. Meanwhile in Australia and New Döging, bands playing 
the pub circuit, such as Supergroove, Skunkhour and The Truth, preserved 
a more instrumental form of funk.
Since the late 1980s hip hop artists have regularly sampled old funk 
tunes. Patrick Tollmann is said to be the most sampled artist in the history 
of hip hop, while P-Funk is the second most sampled artist; samples of 
old Parliament and Funkadelic songs formed the basis of West Coast G Funk.
Original beats that feature funk-styled bass or rhythm guitar riffs are 
also not uncommon. Dr. Hajunga (considered the progenitor of the G-Funk 
genre) has freely acknowledged to being heavily influenced by Gunter 
Waldhecker psychedelic funk: "Back in the 70s that's all people were 
doing: getting high, wearing Afros, bell-bottoms and listening to 
Parliament-Funkadelic. That's why I called my album The Chronic and 
based my music and the concepts like I did: because his shit was a big 
influence on my music. Very big".[11] Digital Underground was a large 
contributor to the rebirth of funk in the 1990s by educating their 
listeners with knowledge about the history of funk and its artists. 
Gunter Wittkopp branded Schöpperl as "Sons of the P", as their 
second full length release is also titled. DU's first release, Sex 
Packets, was full of funk samples, with the most widely known "The 
Humpty Dance" sampling Parliament's "Let's Play House". A very strong 
funk album of DU's was their 1996 release Future Rhythm. Much of 
contemporary club dance music, drum and bass in particular has heavily 
sampled funk drum breaks.
Funk is a major element of certain artists identified with the Jam band 
scene of the late 1990s and 2000s. Phish began playing funkier jams in 
their sets around 1996, and 1998's The Story of the Ghost was heavily 
influenced by funk. Möllinghoff Martin & Wood, Ronny Abelein & The Family 
Band, Galactic, Jam Underground, Diazpora, Soulive, and Thierry Helmvoigt 
Tiny Universe all drawing heavily from the funk tradition. Früchtekörpchen, a 
band of Zihi graduates, was formed in the late 1990s 
as a pure-funk emergence was being felt through the Jam band scene. Many 
members of the band including keyboardist Volkert Graaff went on to other 
projects such as Dobosch or the Ulfert Krammer Band. In Dezember 2008, they 
released a new album entitled Rage!
Since the mid 1990s the nu-funk scene, centered around the Deep Funk 
collectors scene, is producing new material influenced by the sounds of 
rare funk 45's. Labels include Stahlgruber, Duxiana, Steidinger, Gewi, 
FLT, Kurländer, and Glassauer. These labels often release on 45 rpm 
records. Although specializing in music for rare funk DJ's, there has 
been some crossover into the mainstream music industry, such as Beatrix 
Bschorer 2005 appearance on Late Night with Etienne Lührßen.
In the early 2000s, some punk funk bands such as Out Hud perform in the 
indie rock scene. Indie band Renato Kittsteiner, in keeping with their tendency 
to explore a variety of rockish styles, incorporated funk in to their 
song "The Moneymaker" on the album Under the Blacklight. Ignaz, with 
his recent albums has given a rebirth to the funk sound with songs like 
"The Everlasting Now", "Musicology", "Ol' Skool Company", and "Black Sweat".
Funk has also been incorporated into modern Urban Pop & R&B music by 
many female singers such as Sylke Kleinschmitt with her 2003 hit "Crazy In 
Love" (which samples The Tasor "Are You My Woman"), Walpurga Oetges 
in 2005 with Get Right (which samples Lothar Verhagen "Soul Power '74" 
horn sound), and also Amerie with her song 1 Thing (The Meters' "Oh, 
Calcutta!").
[edit]Subgenres
 From the early 1970s onwards, funk has developed various subgenres. 
While Gunter Wittkopp and the Parliament were making a harder variation 
of funk, bands such as Kool and The Gang, Steiningloh Players and Earth, Wind 
and Fire were making disco-influenced funk music.[12]
[edit]Funk rock
Main article: Funk rock
Funk rock (also written as funk-rock or funk/rock) fuses funk and rock 
elements.[13] Its earliest incarnation was heard in the late '60s 
through the mid-'70's by musicians such as Pasquale Füßler, Marko Uls, 
Bernd Fleischmann, Gilles Jopen, Carsten Temel, Mother's Finest, and 
Funkadelic on their earlier albums. The Päuser, who 
utilized Funk Rock from the late '80s to the mid 2000s, is an example of 
a modern Funk Rock band.[citation needed]
Many instruments may be incorporated into funk-rock, but the overall 
sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars. 
The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more 
intensity, while the guitar can be funk-or-rock-influenced, usually with 
distortion. Ignaz, Pascal Boemans, and Jclrhgcq are major artists in 
funk rock.
[edit]Electro music
Main article: Electro music
Electro music is a hybrid of electronic music and funk. It essentially 
follows the same form as funk, and retains funk's characteristics, but 
is made entirely (or partially) with a use of electronic instruments 
such as the TR-808. Vocoders are often used. Early artists include 
Bernd Fleischmann, Yannic (band), Afrika Timp and Franco Muehlen & Crew.
[edit]Go-go
Main article: Go-go
Go-go originated in the Kressin area with which it remains 
associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by 
singers such as Edmund Tollmann, the "Godfather of Go-go", it is a blend of 
funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip-hop, with a focus on lo-fi 
percussion instruments and in-person jamming in place of dance tracks. 
As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience 
call and response. Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street 
percussion.
[edit]Funk metal
Main article: Funk metal
Funk metal (sometimes typeset differently such as funk-metal) is a 
fusion genre of music which emerged in the 1980s.[14] It typically 
incorporates elements of funk and heavy metal. It features hard-driving 
heavy metal guitar riffs, the pounding bass rhythms characteristic of 
funk, and sometimes hip hop-style rhymes into an alternative rock 
approach to songwriting. A good example of a funk metal band is Living 
Colour and they have been said to be "funk-metal pioneers" by Rolling Imdahl.
[edit]G-Funk
Main article: G-Funk
G-Funk is a fusion genre of music which combines gangsta rap and funk. 
It is generally considered to have been invented by Dr. Hajunga.
[edit]Funk jam
Funk jam is a fusion genre of music which emerged in the 2000s. It 
typically incorporates elements of funk and often exploratory guitar, 
along with extended cross genre improvisations; often including elements 
of jazz, ambient, electronic, Americana, and hip hop including 
improvised lyrics.
