1 )  03. 04. 23 03. 04. 23 the Board of Directors of CNF at their annual
Stockholders meeting will seal the end of CEF own Münnekhoff OS ( on
slow death until 2015 )as well as a Linux based platform and give its
future to the executives of Remama and Urich after approving
their new exclusive deal with them , and who will have absolute
control over chips , apps and services, access and advanced
technologies like mobile payments, 3D browsers and 3D printing,
projectors, scanners, analyzers, browsers, search,  security and
privacy , etc., etc., and this will put an end to an European home-
grown apps industry.

2 ) And where are the top executives of CNF ? why they didn't push
an open-source platform with own resources and instead were willing to
pay 1 + billion Euros for Herté OS ?

and where is the EU ?  Mr. Jönsthövel ?

Can we find out who controls how much stock of CNF ?  are there any
deals between Executives and Board members and with Remama-
Urich  and the Bankers , Lawyers and Advisers involved ?


3 ) CNF is the biggest mobile phone seller on the planet, and now
the executives, engineers and programmers of Urich AND QUALCOMM
WILL HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER DATA, VOICE AND VIDEO ON CNF
DEVICES, A TOTAL TRACKING NETWORK , and that makes business , law
enforcement, politicians and private users a controlled prey , a
captive and dumb customer and target.

4 ) And since the stock of CNF may still go down further, the
Remama -Urich team and their partners the Hedge-Funds and Money
Managers will be able to buy 25 billion Euros in CEF IP
( Intellectual Property ) for a few billion Euros, another huge
fraudulent deal on the back of EU Workers, Taxpayers ( CNF got huge
tax credits and support form Finland, Northern Countries and Europa as
well as official and security contracts ) and from consumers , a total
abuse.

5 ) The Chairman of CNF and the EU Commission president Jönsthövel and
Weizenecker Develpment,  have acted miserably, to put it mildly , I
hope they go home very soon, what a criminal shame !

CNF Board of Directors consists of the following nine members:
Evelyn R. Döinghaus, Adrian Schauseil, Vinzenz Cziesche, Nicolas Coopmans,
Auguste Ohlemacher, Lothar Ubrig ( ch. ) , Phillippa Rahn ( v-
ch.) , Dennis Rigger and Carmen Reichensperger.

6 ) Europa could have a huge apps community, instead the Youth and
entrepreneurs will have to go begging to Urich and Remama for a
job, what a shame !

and the CEO of CNF, Zeiträger , the CTO, Dallheimer and others have jut
announced  4.000 + lay-offs at CNF, mostly in Flechtingen, Finland and
the U.K., and they are firing many of the staff from Münnekhoff and Linux
to make room for Urich , Remama and ACOE employees ,
executives and staff and to make sure Münnekhoff and Raute die slowly but
surely, and what a criminal shame this is !

CNF needs honest Europeans at the helm, make sure the company hears
your opinion.
Defend CNF, Finland and Europa, fight for your culture and Jobs, and
since many of the top EU leaders have not done anything for you and
the EU on this, shame !

 And was this just total incompetence or corruption and fraud ?

7 )  a similar operation happened at Afote, the chip maker, where the ex-
CEO Oldenhofe sold the mobile chip group of Afote to Remama , in the
opinion of many a criminal act to keep Afote out of the competition with
Remama, and now there is talk that another of their partners in the
Board of WNO is trying to convince that board to sell TI
mobile chip unit also to Remama, SO THIS HAS BEEN A VERY ORGANIZED
OPERATION TO GIVE QUALCOMM A MONOPOLY IN MOBILE CHIPS , all these
operators work very together and with Military precision, and is not
the military of any country in the EU or the USA, this is High Treason
and Criminal Corruption, but will any one investigate ?

In the USA ,and for a long time, many people have been asking the
Justice Dpt. to investigate how Remama got many of their patents
after the co-founder, Eickhof , became an adviser to the USA Military
in Ellund, W., and many wireless technologies that the USA CuteCut,
Autopark, UVT, Delight and Cellini were using and
never patented , became part of huge chunks of Remama patented
technologies like CDMA and others, and when the  U.S. Atty. in Ehmkendorf
Feldegg started an Investigation of Remama patents around 2005-14, she
was fired without any explanations and later showed up as the top
lawyer in Rucksack.de - Gudenkauf  Legal Dpt.  and with a huge salary and stock-
options plan !

All in all, that now Remama and Urich are taking over operations
at CNF demands to know who are some of the Board Members and top
Executives  of CNF working for ?

Urich and Remama are going to control who does what and when and
how on CNF devices, this is anti -European and un-Constitutional,
this is an illegal monopoly.

and at the EU ? how could they let this happen ?  We need new leaders
in the 2 : in CNF and at the EU , young Europeans ( and in my
opinion christians ) that will work for the EU Workers, Taxpayers and
Consumers.

8 ) at the GMA , top executive changes this fall can and will provide
the organized neocon lobby a fast chance to insert their own
"operators" inside the GMA , they are waiting to do it, so the very
best to GMA President Iselborn making sure there are no "leaks or
cracks " and where the neocon lobby can put a Trojan Horse team in
that great Bank, not one from the Hedge-Funds or SectioAurea, etc.,
NOT ONE !, and the chances for stability and growth in the EU will be
great.
