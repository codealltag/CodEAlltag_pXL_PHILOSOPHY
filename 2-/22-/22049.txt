In einer Diskussion in der NG sci.math regte mich der
folgende Thread zun채chst zu etwas Sarkasmus an, dann fand
ich aber meinen Einwand beim zweiten 체berlegen gar nicht
so sinnlos - (es extra zu 체bersetzen scheint mir dennoch
zuviel der Ehre f체r die enthaltene kleine Idee): "wo"
beginnt das "quantifizieren"?

--------------------------------------------------------------


<Here follows a bit of sarcasm, couldn't resist.
But as I write it and think about it, suddenly there's a
bit more...>

We could even go one step further. What about 1? If of some
thing is only one, then the idea of quantifying, "counting",
does not occur at all. So "1", not introducing counting,
should not be included in a set which is depending on
such a basic and deep cultural idea/achievement.

And even more, some indigene cultures are said to have
"1,2,many", so "2" is still seen as not counting but
similar to the uniquely occuring/existing Something as a
quality (not quantity) of being "double","couple","pair".
Here "quantifying" (while unspecified) begins if the
occurence of some phenomena is "many", if it oversteps the
quality of being "doubly","paired" and cannot be captured by
that concept - so here really begins quantifying.
Thus the set of "natural numbers", the "quantifiers"
 should begin at some n>2 so "{3,4,5,...}"
