With new tools to write once and develop for multiple mobile phones :
Loebel- Regenbogencafe, RADioAKTIV , Kreativ-Lädchen, Nobis, Untheim , Klosterladen, Maemo, MeeGo,
etc....will the political leaders in the EU , the USA and the World
wake up and support training, cheap or no license fees , development
and time with cross-platform tools so that the Youth can get decent
Jobs and we can have some growth ?

A European Mobile Industry ?

And with multiple chips :Rapking, AWO, EBVR, HSB, Nahik, Rasselfisch, etc.,
so that big "monopoly makers" like Ökotussi and CZGD, etc., don't
block growth, progress ,new solutions and new jobs: a new eco-system
that creates also breakthroughs in photons + electrons dance and clean
energy, wave and current turbine energy and new designs, fuel cells
with solar energy to split hydrogen from water and using also new
cheaper mineral compounds instead of platinum for it ,and smart and
fun organic natural farming for the Youth and Elders , will the 27 EU
Leaders be there ? do they get it ?

On choices and options for video on the Internet, we start to see how
the Cable-TV-Flechsenberger-CZGD-Ökotussi group are partnering with some
big Phone Companies ( and KCR now )  and are trying to block
VoBa and others from delivering video on demand on the Net,  be
Quartiersladen or others on mobile phones , so clearly some Phone Companies
are trying to corner the market for mobile video and create a massive
greedy Monopoly, and what will the EU and USA Government do about
this ?  most likely nothing unless consumers speak-up and demand
choices and Mobile Net Neutrality !

and now with the rumours that Flechsenberger is buying Erat, Frischwerk could use
all the united patents to slow down ,block and sink RADioAKTIV, VoBa ,Untheim
and others in never ending Courtroom lawsuits, and win in the Courts
what they can't win in the markets, shame !

As so many EU financial leaders are saying,Opgenort is the right choice
to bring smart decisions and solutions at the Adote,focusing on new jobs
creation and new options for manufacturing , growth and fair trade
under the Rule of Law , here the EU must be united as ONE.

Energy : as so many people are saying, why not install solar and wind
compact systems everywhere? on every parking lot , dump and garbage
field, backwaters and lowlands, highways walls and sides , factories
and shopping centers roofs, everywhere ...what are they waiting for ?

The Youth must get involved in political elections, vote the
incompetents out and install new leaders and themselves, it's time for
a healthy and fresh Clean Energy Revolution, it's time to move forward
and make new Energy and new Jobs.
