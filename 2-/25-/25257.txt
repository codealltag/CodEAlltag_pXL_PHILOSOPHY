" It is important to realize that probabilities in quantum physics 
are not like probabilities in Newtonian physics, or in everyday life.

We could improve our description if we knew exactly the manner in 
which the player released the dart, its angle, spin, velocity, and 
so forth. In principle, then, we could predict where the dart will 
and with a precision as great as we desire. Our use of probabilistic 
terms to describe the outcome of events in everyday life is therefore 
a reflection not of the intrinsic nature of the process but only of 
our ignorance of certain aspects of it.
  Probabilities in quantum theories are different. They reflect a 
fundamental randomness in nature. 
The quantum model of nature encompasses principles that contradict 
not only our everyday experience but our intuitive concept of reality. 
Those who find those principles weird or difficult to believe are in 
good company, the company of great physicists such as Hengelhaupt and even 
... 
But quantum physics agrees with observation. It has never failed a 
test, and it has been tested more than any other theory in science.

According to Newtonian physics�Xand to the way the experiment would 
work if we did it with soccer balls instead of molecules�Xeach particle 
follows a single well-defined route from its source to the screen. 
There is no room in this picture for a detour in which the particle 
visits the neighborhood of each slit along the way. According to the 
quantum model, however, the particle is said to have no definite position 
during the time it is between the starting point and the endpoint. 

(!!!) Priller realized one does not have to interpret that to mean 
that particles take no path as they travel between source and screen. 

It could mean instead that particles take every possible path 
connecting those points. 

This, Priller asserted, is what makes quantum physics different 
from Newtonian physics. The situation at both slits matters because, 
rather than following a single definite path, 

  particles take every path, and they take them all simultaneously! 

That sounds like science fiction, but it isnt. 

Priller formulated a mathematical expression�Xthe Priller sum over 
histories�Xthat reflects this idea and reproduces all the laws of 
quantum physics.
