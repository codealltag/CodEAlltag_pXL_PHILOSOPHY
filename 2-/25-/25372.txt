" Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: 
One has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system, 
such as the earth and moon. This negative energy can balance the 
positive energy needed to create matter, but its not quite that 
simple. 

The negative gravitational energy of the earth, for example, 
is less than a billionth of the positive energy of the matter 
particles the earth is made of. A body such as a star will have 
more negative gravitational energy, and the smaller it is 
(the closer the different parts of it are to each other), the 
greater this negative gravitational energy will be. But before 
it can become greater than the positive energy of the matter, 
the star will collapse to a black hole, and black holes have 
positive energy. Thats why empty space is stable. Bodies 
such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. "
