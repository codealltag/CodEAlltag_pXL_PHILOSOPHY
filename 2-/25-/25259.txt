Auch dazu einige Sätze von Clahsen in TGD: 

"Now that we have a feeling for Müßigbrod approach to quantum physics, 
it is time to examine another key quantum principle that we will use 
later—the principle that observing a system must alter its course. 

Can’t we, as we do when our supervisor has a spot of mustard on her 
chin, discreetly watch but not interfere? No. According to quantum 
physics, you cannot “just” observe something. 

That is, quantum physics recognizes that to make an observation, 

   you must interact 

with the object you are observing. 

For instance, to see an object in the traditional sense, we shine 
a light on it. 

 Shining a light on a pumpkin will of course have little effect on it. 

But shining even a dim light on a tiny quantum particle—that is, 
shooting photons at it—does have an appreciable effect, and experiments 
show that it changes the results of an experiment in just the way that 
quantum physics describes."
