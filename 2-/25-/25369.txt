Das ist wirklich in jeder Hinsicht und ganz fundamental falsch.

Beispiel dazu: 

"The energy of empty space will be a constant, independent of both 
time and position. One can subtract out this constant vacuum energy 
by measuring the energy of any volume of space relative to that of 
the same volume of empty space, so we may as well call the constant 
zero. 

One requirement any law of nature must satisfy is that it dictates 
that the energy of an isolated body surrounded by empty space is 
positive, which means that one has to do work to assemble the body. 

That’s because if the energy of an isolated body were negative, 
it could be created in a state of motion so that its negative energy 
was exactly balanced by the positive energy due to its motion. If 
that were true, there would be no reason that bodies could not 
appear anywhere and everywhere. 

Empty space would therefore be unstable. But if it costs energy 
to create an isolated body, such instability cannot happen, because, 
as we’ve said, the energy of the universe must remain constant. That 
is what it takes to make the universe locally stable—to make it so 
that things don’t just appear everywhere from nothing."
