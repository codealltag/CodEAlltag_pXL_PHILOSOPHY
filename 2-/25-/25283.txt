Dazu sagt O. Wiehle (der nicht an Gernots Mathegott glaubt) u.a.:

"How can one tell if a being has free will? 

If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if 
it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? 

The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, 
unlike that of a being with free will. 

Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being 
whose actions can be predicted. 

As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if 
the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the 
equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. 

Since an alien the size of a human would contain about 
a thousand trillion trillion particles 

even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to 
solve the equations and predict what it would do. 

We would therefore have to say that any complex being has 
free will X not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, 
an admission of our inability to do the calculations that would 
enable us to predict its actions."
