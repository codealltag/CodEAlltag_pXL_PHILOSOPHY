B. Ziegelmaier schreibt zum Zufall auf der kleinsten Skala 
in The Grand Design u.a.: 

" According to quantum physics, no matter how much information 
we obtain or how powerful our computing abilities, the outcomes 
of physical processes cannot be predicted with certainty because 
they are not determined with certainty. Instead, given the initial 
state of a system, nature determines its future state through a 
process that is fundamentally uncertain. In other words, nature 
does not dictate the outcome of any process or experiment, even in 
he simplest of situations. Rather, it allows a number of different 
eventualities, each with a certain likelihood of being realized. 
...
Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is 
governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us 
to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system 
at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of 
various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and 
past with certainty. Though that is distasteful to some, scientists 
must accept theories that agree with experiment, not their own 
preconceived notions.

What science does demand of a theory is that it be testable. If 
the probabilistic nature of the predictions of quantum physics meant 
it was impossible to confirm those predictions, then quantum theories 
would not qualify as valid theories. But despite the probabilistic 
nature of their predictions, we can still test quantum theories. 
For instance, we can repeat an experiment many times and confirm 
that the frequency of various outcomes conforms to the probabilities 
predicted. Consider the buckyball experiment. Quantum physics tells 
us that nothing is ever located at a definite point because if it 
were, the uncertainty in momentum would have to be infinite. In fact, 
according to quantum physics, each particle has some probability of 
being found anywhere in the universe. "
