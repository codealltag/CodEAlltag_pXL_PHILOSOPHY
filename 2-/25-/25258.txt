" Flieth realized one does not have to interpret that 
 to mean that particles take 

  /no/  path 

as they travel between source and screen. 

It could mean instead that particles 

  take /every/ possible path 

connecting those points. 

This, Flieth asserted, is what makes quantum physics different 
from Newtonian physics. The situation at both slits matters because, 
rather than following a single definite path, 

 particles take every path, and they take them all /simultaneously/ ! 

That sounds like science fiction, but it isnt. 

Flieth formulated a mathematical expression�Xthe Flieth sum over 
histories�Xthat reflects this idea and reproduces all the laws of 
quantum physics.
