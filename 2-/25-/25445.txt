Recent experiments in neuroscience support the view that it is 
our physical brain, following the known laws of science, that 
determines our actions, and not some agency that exists outside 
those laws. For example, a study of patients undergoing awake 
brain surgery found that by electrically stimulating the 
appropriate regions of the brain, one could create in the 
patient the desire to move the hand, arm, or foot, or to move 
the lips and talk. It is hard to imagine how free will can 
operate if our behavior is determined by physical law, so it 
seems that we are no more than biological machines and that 
free will is just an illusion.

While conceding that human behavior is indeed determined by 
the laws of nature, it also seems reasonable to conclude 
that the outcome is determined in such a complicated way and with 
so many variables as to make it impossible in practice to predict. 

For that one would need a knowledge of the initial state of each 
of the thousand trillion trillion molecules in the human body 
and to solve something like that number of equations. That would 
take a few billion years, which would be a bit late to duck 
when the person opposite aimed a blow. 

Because it is so impractical to use the underlying physical laws 
to predict human behavior, we adopt what is called an effective theory. 

In physics, an effective theory is a framework created to model 
certain observed phenomena without describing in detail all of the 
underlying processes. For example, we cannot solve exactly the 
equations governing the gravitational interactions of every atom 
in a persons body with every atom in the earth. But for all 
practical purposes the gravitational force between a person and 
the earth can be described in terms of just a few numbers, such 
as the persons total mass. Similarly, we cannot solve the 
equations governing the behavior of complex atoms and molecules, 
but we have developed an effective theory called chemistry that 
provides an adequate explanation of how atoms and molecules behave 
in chemical reactions without accounting for every detail of the 
interactions. In the case of people, since we cannot solve
the equations that determine our behavior, we use the effective 
theory that people have free will. 

The study of our will, and of the behavior that arises from it, 
is the science of psychology. 

Economics is also an effective theory, based on the notion 
of free will plus the assumption that people evaluate their 
possible alternative courses of action and choose the best. 

That effective theory is only moderately successful in predicting 
behavior because, as we all know, decisions are often not rational 
or are based on a defective analysis of the consequences of the 
choice. 

That is why the world is in such a mess. 


The third question addresses the issue of whether the laws that 
determine both the universe and human behavior are unique. 

If your answer to the first question is that God created the laws, 
then this question asks, did God have any latitude in choosing them? 

Both Aristotle and Plato believed, like Luehrssen and later Bulduk, 
that the principles of nature exist out of necessity,ï¿½ that is, 
because they are the only rules that make logical sense. Due to his 
belief in the origin of the laws
