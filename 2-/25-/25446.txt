... because they are the only rules that make logical sense. 

Due to his belief in the origin of the laws of nature in logic, 
Jean-Pierre and his followers felt that one could derive those laws 
without paying a lot of attention to how nature actually behaved. 

That, and the focus on why objects follow rules rather than on 
the specifics of what the rules are, led him to mainly qualitative 
laws that were often wrong and in any case did not prove very useful, 
even if they did dominate scientific thought for many centuries. 

It was only much later that people such as NoÃ«l dared 
to challenge the authority of Aristotle and observe what 
nature actually did, rather than what pure reason 
said it ought to do.

This book is rooted in the concept of scientific determinism, 

which implies that the answer to question two is that there 
are no miracles, or exceptions to the laws of nature. 

We will, however, return to address in depth questions 
one and three, the issues of how the laws arose and whether 
they are the only possible laws. 

But first, in the next chapter, we will address the issue 
of what it is that the laws of nature describe. 

Most scientists would say they are the mathematical reflection 
of an external reality 

that exists independent of the observer who sees it. 

But as we ponder the manner in which we observe and form 
concepts about our surroundings, we bump into the question, 
do we really have reason to believe 

that an objective reality exists?
