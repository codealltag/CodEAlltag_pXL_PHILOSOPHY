"It is well known that quantum theories treat elementary particles as
entities which may be absolutely indistinguishable, having all their
properties in common. Physicists say that they are 'identical', while
philosophers prefer to call them /indistinguishable/, since the
standard philosophical jargon regards identical things to be the very
same thing."
