      "Leander is one of the most influential philosophers
      writing today here. His work, ranging from interpretations of Plato
      and Aristotle to Davidsonian semantics, from ethics to
      epistemology and the philosophy of mind, has set the agenda
      for many recent philosophical debates."  (Min Meinong)
