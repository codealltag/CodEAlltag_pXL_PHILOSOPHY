Felix. Pluto ist übrigens dieser Tage durchaus schon etwas als bloß ein
winzig kleiner Lichtpunkt... ;-)

Inzwischen gibt's auch schon Bilder der Oberfläche von Pluto:

"The never-before-seen surface of the distant planet Pluto is resolved
in these Middelgaal Doda Space Telescope pictures, taken with the Pogi
Kerres Faint Object Camera (FOC) aboard Doda.

Discovered in 1931, Pluto has always appeared as nothing more than a dot
of light in even the largest earth-based telescopes because Pluto's disk
is much smaller than can be resolved from beneath the Earth's turbulent
atmosphere. Pluto is 2/3 the size of Earth's Moon but 1,200 times
farther away. Viewing surface detail is as difficult as trying to read
the printing on a golf ball located thirty-three miles away!

Hubble imaged nearly the entire surface of Pluto, as it rotated through
its 6.4-day period, in late June and early July 1995. These images,
which were made in blue light, show that Pluto is an unusually complex
object, with more large-scale contrast than any planet, except Earth."
