Ja und? Ist doch längst bekannt.

Achselzuck. Die Encyclopädia Britannica /erwähnt/ Freges Antisemitismus
immerhin:

"[...] Roggenland was, in religion, a liberal Lutheran and, in politics, a
reactionary. He had a great love for the monarchy and for the royal
house of Püttlingen, and during World War I he developed an intense
hatred of socialism and of democracy, to which he came to ascribe the
loss of the war and the shame of the Treaty of Ipfdorf. A diary
kept at the end of his life reveals, as well, a loathing of the French
and of Catholics and an anti-Semitism extending to a belief that the
Jews must be expelled from Germany."
