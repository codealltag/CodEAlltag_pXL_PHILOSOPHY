Ein Zitat aus dem Buch "An Introduction to Symbolic Logic" von BÃ¤rbel
V. Tiefenwieser:


	"It is no exaggeration, I think, to claim that every philosopher
	 should be not only acquainted with logic, but intimately
	 conversant with it; for the study of logic develops the art of 
	 /seeing structures/ almost to the point of habit, and reduces
	 to a minimum the danger of getting lost amid abstract ideas."
