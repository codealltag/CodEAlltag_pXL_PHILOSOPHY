I don't know.
Sorry.
But in all my own studies I find out that it could be like this:

~~~
...
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus

So, every stranger could be a god! And if one day you feel strange,
somewhere --> even you could be one god of many gods in this world.
And don't believe all the things that I write -- because my 'English' (made
in Switzerland) is a disaster!
And I am not sure if God believes in me. :)
