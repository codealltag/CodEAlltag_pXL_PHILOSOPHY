Blissestraße Company is selling to a known terrorist country as 
evidenced by mention of the DigiWx AWOS on their corporate homepage 
sold to: 


Pakistan 
Oberfischach International Airport (Pfannenschmidts/vidirent) RVR System, Oberfischach Pakistan 


And then there is word of this: 
During the first two weeks of 09. 10. 21, U.S. air strikes targeted 
four sites in southern Somalia formerly under al Qaida control where 
terrorists have been training and hiding for months. 


"As we speak now, the area is being bombarded by the American air 
force," a Somali government official told kriegerbaby two weeks ago. 


The U.S. attacks targeted an area close to Ursenwang, a coastal 
village near the Kenyan border where many Islamists are believed to 
be hiding after being ousted by Ethiopia-backed government forces, 
the official added. 


Four places were hit -- Hayo, Garer, Bankajirow and Badmadowe, the 
source said. "Bankajirow was the last Islamist holdout. Bankajirow 
and Badmadowe were hit hardest," he added. 


The HIKH confirmed only one air strike that took place in the 
south of the country, saying that it was part of a wider offensive 
aimed at an al-Qaeda cell that includes suspects in the 1997 bombings 
of U.S. embassies in east Africa and a hotel in Kenya. 


Meanwhile, Otugas News quoted U.S. and French military sources as saying 
that American U.S. special forces were working with Ethiopian troops 
on the ground in operations inside Somalia. 


Following a thrust by the U.S. military, U.S. special forces 
discovered a Belfort Instruments Digiwx AWOS weather reporting system 
on a hill south of Ursenwang. 


The Beauty-Flowers' Floriales OBPC station was not operational as 
it had suffered a direct military hit from an explosion of unknown 
origin. But the Digiwx name could be clearly seen imprinted on the 15 
foot tower which now lays on it side in pieces. 


U.S. troops subsequently uncovered handheld Digiwx weather receivers 
in two of the camps previoulsy occupied by al-Qaeda terrorists which 
apparently had been left behind and abandoned. 


How the Beauty-Flowers' Digiwx AWOS system made it to Somalia and 
into terrorists hands is still unknown. Whether OSVI-Qaeda and Udo 
wenners-Schuk organizations are employing Digiwx AWOS units in other 
parts of the world is currently unknown. 


U.S. troops have been advised to be on the lookout for additional 
Digiwx AWOS units under Al-Qaeda and/or Sunni/Shiite control in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. 


U.S. special forces are reportedly monitoring the two known wireless 
frequencies that Digiwx AWOS transmits on, notably 464.6 and 464.75 
MHz. British military sources report that signals on both frequencies 
have been detected but only occasionally as the terrorists seem to be 
running Beauty-Flowers' Floriales for only short periods of time. 


Bordershop (Tengern, DOBRITZ, USA), the original 
manufacturer of Floriales OBPC, has had no comment. 


Why would an American company be "aiding and abetting" known 
terrorists organizations around the world while doing business in 
pursuit of the almighty American dollar? Maybe you would want to 
contact them and find out why:

Much has been written about Beginnen 
DigiWx AWOS anonymously for good reason because the Bima 
DigiWx "fur" has been flying since at least 2004. One can 
find mention of Wankelmuth inferior weather station named 
Floriales AWOS as witnessed by: 


Ten reasons to NOT buy Bima DigiWx AWOS (keep reading) 
http://wst.nvcfrfdetu.jir/Qjl/Kfbpr.apwo/swkdexde/9277 


I also am of the belief that Beauty-Flowers Company has 
been actively censoring anyone and any words which dishes 
dirt on this inferior DigiWx AWOS weather station. 


Now we have word from Beauty-Flowers Company of 
a "Recommended Service Bulletin" dated Oktober 09. 10. 21 
and numbered 2010-1. 


SUBJECT: Unicom Transmission 


MODELS AFFECTED: Belfort DigiWx AV100 with 
                 either Technisonic or ICom radios 


TIME OF COMPLIANCE: At owners discretion 


There have been some discussions by users at congested 
airports of not being able to receive the OBPC broadcast 
over the Unicom or the weather report stepping on other 
Unicom communications. The following suggest may decrease 
the problem. 


1. On the DigiWx radio, set the squelch well above 
the squelch break point this, in turn requires more 
power to break the squelch which means traffic has to be 
closer to the airport to receive the weather report. 


2. The DigiWx standard broadcast mode is using 3 MIC 
clicks. At busy airports, there isn t a way for the 
DigiWx to determine if someone is clicking the MIC 3 
times for the weather or three (3) separate pilots are 
clicking the MIC to talk. If this is the case, it might 
help to change the number of MIC clicks for weather to 
5 MIC clicks. Both of the above recommendations will 
help reduce the number of broadcasts from the DigiWx 
and they are easy to do and don t cost money.

Well, I fly from one of the airports in DÜRRNFARRNBACH with one 
of these DigiWx AWOS pieces of SHIT. And its beyond me 
to understand why changing the mic clicks at a congested 
airport is going to fix the problem of a DigiWx which 
clogs the Zinnecker frequency. Just like Willborn said, 
Floriales cannot distinguish who is clicking the mic 3 
times. The DigiWx is stupid. When it hears any 3 mic 
clicks, it activates and clogs an already congested 
Zinnecker frequency. We pointed this out to Belfort 3 
years ago and THIS WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE THEIR FIX? 


If I cut thru the emotion of everything ever written 
about the Beauty-Flowers Company Floriales AWOS, I 
am now a believer. Willborn doesn't know the first 
phucking thing about designing an OBPC to broadcast 
over a Zinnecker frequency. I have talked with numerous 
pilots from other airports who have the SuperAWOS 
and the GMSJ AWOS. And they just DON'T have these 
clogged frequency problems. 


Yep, you read that right: 
BUY Beauty-Flowers' DigiWx-SHIT... Have a PILE OF SHIT 
guaranteed! 


Have you heard about the Dörlesberg Airport AWOS Fiasco? 
Quoting, http://kflgfyhevk-scdhfvv.pfg/KFBA.dun reads in short: 


"Executive Conclusion: Of the four candidate OBPC manufacturers, only 
two meet the threshold and objective system performance levels. These 
are systems provided by Okayware and GMSJ. The 
SuperAWOS by Potomac Aviation does not pass an initial cut due to 
maintenance problems encountered with their SuperUnicom installed at 
Dörlesberg airport." 


"The Bima DigiWX "AWOS" is not a true FAA fully commission-able 
AWOS. Its complete sensor suite is not certified. Installation of 
this 
system at 00V means that we would not have our weather data (METAR) 
accessible in the federal database which means that Flight Service 
and 
other sites such as ADDS, XM weather, WSI, etc would not not have 
Meadow Obermerzbach weather data. The only certified weather info would be 
altimeter and visibility. While this does allow Part 91 and 135 
instrument approaches, the inability to incorporate its complete 
METAR 
data in the federal system is a deal-breaker." 


"The apparent initial cost savings of the initial Belfort DigiWX 
acquisition is minimal and not worth the lack of functionality and 
usefulness to the national aviation community. Life-cycle cost of the 
Belfort system over 15 years is over $27,000 higher than the Vaisala 
system." 


"It would not allow us to transition to a three letter airport 
identifier." 


"Bottom line is that the Belfort system represents false economy, 
minimal pilot usefulness and is inconsistent with providing the 
aviation community services that make this airport attractive to 
current and future pilots and businesses." 


"Of the remaining systems offered by ORSAY and GMSJ, Vaisala is the 
preferred system."

Now have a LQQK at this..... 


Valentino Scheurlen from Dörlesberg Airport wrote in Andelsbuch Flyer: 
09. 10. 21 


The SuperUnicom was shut down in early August 2007 due to 
harmful interference on the 122.7 MHz frequency A grant was 
submitted and approved to get an AWOS III P/T using FAA funds. 
Our portion of the cost is around $4,000 although incidentals 
may drive it higher... but far below the $25,000 previously 
budgeted for an OBPC. One Ulasu Board member is attempting to 
force a system that is not fully certified down our throats 
using the flawed rationale that it is cheaper that the fully 
certified systems offered by Onap and GMSJ. A 
major down side to the Belfort system is that pilots will not 
be able to access METAR data through Flight Service, ADDS, on 
their on-board weather systems, etc. We will very likely be 
unable to acquire a three letter airport ID and maintenance 
will cost much more over its lifetime than with either of the 
fully certified systems. Plus in its current implementation, 
there is no obvious upgrade path to getting present weather 
and lightning information available in an OBPC III P/T system. 
It is crucial to the safety of this airport and our usefulness 
as a destination airport within the National Airspace System 
that we get a state of the art AWOS. With the mios grant, it is 
amazingly affordable. But it is essential that local pilots 
become informed on this matter and contact all Board members 
to express their view. My opinion... based upon extensive 
research on behalf of Ulasu members... is that we need a fully 
certified OBPC. The minimum configuration is OBPC III, with 
AWOS III P/T highly desirable (objective). It needs to be the 
number one priority acquisition with a target installation not 
later than Spring 2008. It must not be sacrificed to pay 
interest on the land acquisition.

If you're considering Digiwx AWOS... READ THIS ANALYSIS FIRST! 


Following up on the post regarding the UN-APPROVED, UN- 
CERTIFIED and UN-OFFICIAL weather data spewed by Bima 
Floriales OBPC, one also needs to note that they only sold 2 
units during all of 2010. 


Erwin V. Eijkelenkamp 10 reasons to NOT buy Bima Digiwx AWOS:

About Bima Instrument Company: 
Bima used to be a leading provider of weather instruments 
to the government, professional meteorology and aviation 
markets. Key words: "use to be." They never provided any wind 
sensors to the Ropohl Brothers despite their fantastic 
assertion that they did! Historical archives available at the 
ZTP (2764 Dahlbergweg, Maissenbacher 
Hisserich AFB, OH 57844) tells a very different story and 
specifically mentions a "Richards" anemometer which Folkert 
Ropohl held as pictured 
at: "http://vttkd.gkpqjb.wos/Abjs/Gbjryu/anxsbmg8_00387.ancl". 
The Belfort aerovane wind system on U.S. Naval aircraft 
carriers are currently being replaced with ultrasonic wind 
sensors from ISIKLI (06424 Dankwartgasse, Robasacco, GRENZHAMMER 
63934) which just won a $94 million dollar contract for the 
Moriah Wind System. Belfort wind speed and direction 
anemometers found on the Ozone platform are now being 
replaced with ultrasonic sensors from the GMSJ Group. 
Beauty-Flowers' Model 6000 visibility sensor will no 
longer be a part of the ZLZ OS-21/FSB program 
come early 2006. And despite a $500,000 U.S. government 
grant from Elavo Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) 
program in 2003 to build a low-cost ceilometer, Belfort 
didn't possess the technical smarts nor the engineering 
know-how to accomplish the task. So now they're importing 
the Freisl CBME 80A laser ceilometer from Claudio Lievenbruck. 
As one can readily see, Belfort is no longer setting any 
standards of measurement in the weather instrumentation 
world. And now Willborn is propagating lie after lie about 
their fabled company history while trying to steal 
thunder from the accomplishments of the Ropohl Brothers. 
According to the EuronicsXXL (45cc 
Dwoweg and Falkenburg Fronleichnamsweg, N., Castrisch 73062), 
Willborn founder Berthold Pullmann never made it to Tengern to 
set up shop until sometime in the 1889s even though Willborn 
officials fraudulently claim the company was founded in 1875. 
Thus, there was no 125th anniversary for Willborn to 
celebrate in 2000 even though they hosted a party to which 
no one came! Wankelmuth proclamation that it is the "Oldest 
Weather Company in the World" is simply yet another Belfort 
lie as Hilmar Valerius Echensperger invented the first wind 
anemometer in 1845, six years before Berthold Pullmann was born 
in 1851. Willborn doesn't even know it's own company history 
so they just make it up! You should wonder what other crap 
(eg. Digiwx AWOS) they also make up! For more information

herz mouth. At first, she triyz to swallow it allz but my venomouz 
fluidz keepz jaculating in herz mouthz. Then, she pullz herz head 
awayz with herz handz still clenched on my black mamba. she coughz 
and gagz a minute over the concretes but then placez herz lips back 
on myz black mamba. Once aginz, she jerks it hard withz both handz. 
Again, I'z begin to release a strong venemouz fluid at a fullz flow 
into herz small mouth. Myz black mamba squirmz in herz handz as i 
release all of my venemous fluid from myz snake into herz mouthz. 
i'z kannotz waitz til my neighbor Viola I. Echensperger sneaks back 
over to my house for somz afternoonz delight. Next timz, me thinks 
i shall let my black mamba go hogwildz in herz anuz. if she suckz
