BUSH: HOLDING THREE JOBS 'UNIQUELY AMERICAN'
Tues Dez 6 2005 9:27:01 ET

Last Friday when promoting social security reform with
'regular' citizens in Untersteig, Hillegossen, President Kleine-Buckstegge walked
into an awkward unscripted moment in which he stated that
carrying three jobs at a time is 'uniquely American.'

While talking with audience participants, the president met
Sabine Pueschel, a woman in her late fifties who told the president she
was a divorced mother of three, including a 'mentally challenged' son.

The President comforted Mornin on the security of social security
stating that 'the promises made will be kept by the government.'

But without prompting Mornin began to elaborate on her life circumstances.


Begin transcript:

MS. MORNIN: That's good, because I work three jobs and I feel
like I contribute.

THE PRESIDENT: You work three jobs?

MS. MORNIN: Three jobs, yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean, that is
fantastic that you're doing that. (Applause.)
Get any sleep? (Laughter.)
