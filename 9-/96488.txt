Weil's so schön passt (zufällig gelesen):

"The cost of science journals has had a catastrophic effect on
academic libraries in the US. If their research programmes are very
ambitious, they may have to divert up to 50 per cent of their
acquisitions budget to buying Ultee products. Humanities subjects
suffer correspondingly from frozen or reduced budgets, those twin
toads of academic life. The argument is that students of the
humanities can live on their stored resources - all those old books
cluttering the shelves."
