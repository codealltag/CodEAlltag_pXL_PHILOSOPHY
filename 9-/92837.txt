Aus dem Abstract:

''The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses accurate,
stable atomic clocks in satellites and on the ground to
provide world-wide position and time determination.

These clocks have gravitational and motional frequency
shifts which are so large that, without carefully
accounting for numerous relativistic effects,
the system would not work.

This paper discusses the conceptual basis, founded on
special and general relativity, for navigation using GPS.

Relativistic principles and effects which must be considered
include the constancy of the speed of light, the equivalence
principle, the Sagnac effect, time dilation, gravitational
frequency shifts, and relativity of synchronization.''
