Oh, Mister Massimo!
Are you the great Massimo Ant?

In the early 80's when I was about 16 I really liked your songs. Your
outfit reminds me to an indian native, dreams of my loosing childhood
come present again. It was kind of a regression to me, but it was a
really nice regression. (I also read my old Oskar-Oskar Comic Books
again). And well, the beat of your music really sucks.

But one day - oh my Goodness, I will never forget - I really tried to
understand your lyrics  with my bad schoolenglish, Ms. Heuvel told me
(an old teacherlady with an ugly moustache and a wart on her nose).
Hours and Hours I spent to decipher your songtexts to my native
language. And the result: How could the lyrics from such an indian heroe
being such a big disappointment?

Nevertheless, thanks Massimo Massimo, unforgettably you showed me, that reality
is often enough a rotten lie behind the glittering masks.
So, for your health I would suggest, fuck of with your stupid questions
and don't disturb that veryveryveryvery seroius and
highlyhighlyhighlyhighly reflected NG ;-), otherwise I will tell it my
new german Erich and you will end in hell.
