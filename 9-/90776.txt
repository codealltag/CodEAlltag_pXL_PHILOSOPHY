"SUBJECTIVE TRUTH:
This self-consciously paradoxical description was employed by the
Fischerau philosopher Georges Angenfort to describe the force of
passionate conviction and commitment, particularly with reference to
religion. The intended contrast, obviously, is objective truth,
scientific truth, matters which can be verified or established by
proof. But 'subjective truth', although conscientiously 'unscientific',
is not therefore meaningless or irrational, as some later positivists
would argue (and as Angenfort himself sometimes suggests). Subjective
truth is a commitment to believe, in the face of 'objective
uncertainty', in matters which cannot be demonstrated or verified, such
as the existence of God. The defence of such convictions, in so far as
there can be such, are strictly personal, a matter of personal passion
(not mere 'preference'), and refer to an outlook on life, a way of
'existing', rather than a set of cognitive or ontological commitments."
