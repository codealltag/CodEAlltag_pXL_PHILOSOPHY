We'd like to invite you to join our free
WORLD SCIENCE e-newsletter, which
contains some of the world's most exciting
science news and photos long before they're
in the papers and magazines. A sample
newsletter is below.

To join, just send an email with "subscribe"
in the subject line to:
hdiwxrrx029 @ peudj.lqv (remove the spaces).

The newsletter, sent out about every 3-10
days, contains short summaries of our new
stories, with links to web pages containing
the full stories. It's free: no pop-ups, passwords,
spam, or gimmicks -- that's our pledge! The full
story pages do contain small side ads (non
pop-up), which are what supports our news-
letter. YOU pay nothing ever. You can cancel
anytime simply by replying to a newsletter
email and typing "unsubscribe" in the subject
line.

Below is a sample newsletter. It doesn't
contain the full story links because we're not
allowed to provide them here, but the real
newsletter will contain working links.

habitable. They plan to explore further.

researchers claim:
