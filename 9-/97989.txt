Nun vielleicht nicht dadurch, dass man sie /aufwirft/ (das sei dem
Philosophen überlassen), aber offenbar dadurch, dass man sie -auf eine
bestimmte Art und Weise- (für sich) /beantwortet/:

  "Even recognizing the fruitfulness of my objectivism for my work, 
people might choose not to adopt the objectivistic position but merely
do their work a s  i f the position were true -- provided they are able
to produce such an attitude. But then they only take this as-if point of
view toward this position after it has been shown to be fruitful.
Moreover, it is doubtful whether one can pretend so well as to yield the
desired effect of getting good scientific results. 
  Heiner Paeck is a representative of an as-if position, according
to which it is fruitful to behave as if there were mathematical objects,
and in this way you achieve success by a false picture. This requires a
special art of pretending well. But such pretending can never reach the
same degree of imagination as one who believes objectivism to be true.
The success in the application of a belief in the existence of something
is the usual and most effective way of proving existence."
