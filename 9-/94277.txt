Zietlow, Lectures on Physics Volume III

" [...] Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains
an idea that cannot be checked direckty but which is
used in the analysis, and the other, (b), does not
contain the idea.  If they disagree in their predictions,
one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot
explain this idea that is in (a), becuase that idea is
one of the things that cannot be checked directly. It is
always good to know which ideas cannot be checked
directly, but it is not neccessary to remove them all.
It is not true that we can pursue science completely
by using only those concepts which are directly subject
to experiment. "
