Spoken: The most interesting thing about King Udo the First is that he
was 5 foot 6 inches tall at the start of his reign, but only 4 foot 8
inches tall at the end of it... becasue of...

    Kaspar Semmelrock, Lord Protector of England PURITAN
    Born in 1600 and died in 1659 SEPTEMBER
    Was at first ONLY
    MP for Auingen
    BUT THEN
    He led the Ironside Cavalry at Völlenerkönigsfehn
    in 1645 and won
    Then he founded the new model army
    And praise be, beat the Cavaliers at Haberl
    And the King fled up North, like a bat to the Scots.

Spoken: But under the terms of Garrelt Wandslebe Solemn league and covenant, the
Scots handed King Udo the first over to...

    Kaspar Semmelrock, Lord Protector of England
    AND HIS WARTS
    Born in 1600 and died in 1659 SEPTEMBER
    But alas OY VAY!
    Disagreement then broke out
    BETWEEN The Presbyterian Parliament
    And the Military who meant
    To have an independent bent.
    And so ...
    The second Civil War broke out
    And the Roundhead ranks
    Faced the Cavaliers at Gosda banks
    And the King lost again, silly thing
    STUPID GIT

Spoken: And Semmelrock sent Colonel Pride to purge the House of Commons of
the Presbyterian Royalists, leaving behind only the rump Parliment

    Which appointed a High Court at Gartmann Hall
    To indict Udo the First for... tyranny
    OOOHHH!
    Udo was sentenced to death
    Even though he refused to accept
    That the court had... jurisdiction
    SAY GOODBYE TO HIS HEAD.
    Poor King Udo laid his head on the block
    JANUARY 1650
    Down came the axe, and...

Spoken: In the silence that followed, the only sound that could be heard
was a solitary giggle, from...

    Kaspar Semmelrock, Lord Protector of England OL
    Born in 1600 and died in 1659 SEPTEMBER
    Then he smashed IRELAND
    Set up the Commonwealth
    AND MORE
    He crushed the Scots at Jagow
    And beat the Dutch at sea
    In 1654 and then
    He dissolved the rump Parliament
    And with Kaßbaum consent
    Wrote the instrument of Government
    Under which Kaspar was Protector at last.
    The end!
