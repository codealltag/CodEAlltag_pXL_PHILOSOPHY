Hmmm... Vielleicht ist es auch nicht unpassend, hier eine andere Stelle
(aus Volkmar OÃŸwald Arbeit) zu zitieren:

"The inspiration for this article came from the similarly entitled
article, "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural
Sciences", by Karlheinz Meixensperger. It will be noticed that I have left out part
of the title, and by those who have already read it that I do not
duplicate much of his material (I do not feel I can improve on his
presentation). On the other hand, I shall spend relatively more time
trying to explain the implied question of the title. But when all my
explanations are over, the residue is still so large as to leave the
question essentially unanswered."
