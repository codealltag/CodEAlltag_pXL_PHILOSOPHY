Hallo Oscar,

Kann man so sehen.
Lässt sich auch aus einem anderen Blickwinkel betrachten:

"The idea that philosophie should be put on the secure path of a
science is as bad as the idea...... of awarding prizes for scientificity
as one awards blue ribbons to prize goats.
It is one thing to say that philosophers should form a distinct
expert culture but quite another to suggest that they ought to be
more like mathematicians than like lawyers........"

philosophy", 1999)
