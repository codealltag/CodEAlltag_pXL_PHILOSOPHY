Man kÃ¶nnte "modalitarian logics" auch im Singular verwenden.

Beispiel:

"Modalitarian logic as a 'supersystem' is made up of a family of
modality-related logics such as modal l., epistemic l, temporal l., et
al.

Modal logic, i.e. the logic of possibility and necessity, is the
paradigmatic modalitarian logic.

The symbols ">" and "<" are general modalitarian operators,
which may be specified by being differently interpreted in the
respective modalitarian systems.
For instance, in modal logic these symbols are interpreted by "[]" and
"<>", representing necessity and possibility."
