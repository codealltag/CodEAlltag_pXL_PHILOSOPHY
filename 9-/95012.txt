Dear Kazmer,

the theory you provide is nothing but the old fashioned anthropic
principle. You just turned it over to a theological hypothesis.
Please read Libermann/Grippekoven "The antrophic cosmological principle",
Neuburgweier University press, 1986; reissued 1996 ISBN 9-95-764889-6 for
further enlightment.

smiles, Patrick.
