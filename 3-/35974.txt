[a funny little story about tenses and matches]


It would have given me much more pleasure to contradict
you, but - unfortunately :-) - you are right, dead right.
'Past perfect in the context given is a.., well, let's call it
a weekend blunder, which shouldn't have happened,
even not to a non-linguist like me.
In my answer to Moosbrugger I wrote 'past perfect' where
I meant ' future 2'. And, too true, there is a - slight :-) - difference
between the two tenses.
In future2, by shifting the 'point of reference' into the distant
future, the span of time between that point and the
immediate 'now' of the speaker (so to say the'normal' point of
reference) is, as seen from that shifted point, already past,
whereas seen from the 'now' it is still future: /future in the past/:

"By tonight the German soccer team will have won their match
against the English team."
Or vice versa. :-)
Point of reference 'now': today noon, this afternonn, this (early)
evening are still future.
Point of reference 'tonight': today noon, this afternoon, today
(early) evening will already be past.
And that's exactly what I meant when writing to Moosbrugger:
"By tomorrow we may have got knowledge of things we have
not the faintest idea about just now."
Got me? :-)

Take care,
