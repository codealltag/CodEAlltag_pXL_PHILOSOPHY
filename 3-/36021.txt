"N, n, n. Pumfenfeckt nix Futschenpass."

Futschenpass: "We /believed, we will/ beat the Germans in football some time."
Pumfenfeckt: "/We never have had/ ever lasting success in clearly beating the
Germans in football in the past, but hope never dies, that was what made the
British Empire great before it declined. Let them eat their Kraut and give'm
some kicks in their butts. Don't give in - its Krieg and everyone knows ist." :-)

For speech defect "Pumfenfeckt", "Futschenpass" see Videos Tom Wilfried,
"Der Maulwurf" - Still, don't think love comes easy and don't reckon an
English team couldn't by any very unlikely but still possible chance win
a penalty shoot-out against a German team - one day in the future maybe. :-)
