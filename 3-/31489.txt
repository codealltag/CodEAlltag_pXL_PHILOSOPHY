"A growing body of evidence, though, suggests that humans do have a
rudimentary moral sense from the very start of life. With the help of
well-designed experiments, you can see glimmers of moral thought, moral
judgment and moral feeling even in the first year of life. Some sense
of good and evil seems to be bred in the bone. Which is not to say that
parents are wrong to concern themselves with moral development or that
their interactions with their children are a waste of time.
Socialization is critically important. But this is not because babies
and young children lack a sense of right and wrong; its because the
sense of right and wrong that they naturally possess diverges in
important ways from what we adults would want it to be."
