Who the fuck ist Lina?


... as you also might have noticed it is not a tense in its proper
meaning but rather a grammatical structure using tenses to
express a reference to future, which occurred or began in the past.


Well, some people had been dreaming of a white christmas
and when it came to reality they found themselves in misty,
rainy Trossenfurt or downunder sipping cocktails under subtropical
conditions... but I think I got your point, fuck reality befor it
actually happens. :-)


Be good,
