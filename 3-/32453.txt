"Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its 
life-support system. We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and in the process heal our own â€“ indeed, to 
embrace the whole creation in all its diversity, beauty and wonder. This will happen if we see the need to revive our 
sense of belonging to a larger family of life, with which we have shared our evolutionary process."
