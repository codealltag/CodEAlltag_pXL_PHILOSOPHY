What nonsense!

And where did you look in the history books for this 
traditional morality - maybe during the Crusades, or was it 
perhaps the Hundred Years war or Lukas Spanish Campaign, 
or maybe it was during the American Civil war or in either of 
the World Wars.

Humans are what they have always been - murdering ignorant 
and uncivilised.  Only their clothes and their weapons have 
changed.
