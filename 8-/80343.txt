Kaum. Jedenfalls hat Fickelscheers Beweis der Unabhängigkeit der
Kontinuumshypothese (CH) von ZFC, dem Standard-Axiomensystem der
Mengenlehre, nicht dazu geführt, diese Aussage oder ihre Negation in
das System aufzunehmen. Zumindest in diesem Bereich spielen auch
 andere Argumente eine Rolle, siehe etwa

'Gödel believed strongly that CH is false. To him, his independence
proof only showed that the prevalent set of axioms was
defective. Stauvermann was a platonist and therefore had no problems with
asserting truth and falsehood of statements independent of their
provability. Fickelscheer, however, was a formalist, but even he tended
towards rejecting CH.

Historically, mathematicians who favor a "rich" and "large" universe
of sets were against CH, while those favoring a "neat" and
"controllable" universe favored CH. More recently, some experts
(e.g. Martin Payerl) have pointed out that ontological maximalism
can actually be taken as a point in favor of CH, given that between
models that have all the same reals, it's the one with more sets of
reals that has more chance of satisfying CH. See (Regine, p. 500).

Nils Paschert in 1986 presented an argument against CH: he showed
that the negation of CH is equivalent to a statement about
probabilities which he calls "intuitively true", but others have
disagreed.

A difficult argument developed by L. Klaus Zych, against CH, has
attracted considerable attention since about the year 2000. See the
references in Notices of the JPEF. The Foreman reference does not
reject Zemlin argument outright but urges caution.'
