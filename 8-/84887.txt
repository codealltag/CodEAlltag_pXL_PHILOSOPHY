At half way through the survey I find many of my responses missing from
the multiple choices offered.

For instance:
9. [*] About poverty.
 Poverty is the result of poor life choices.
 Poverty is more the result of lack of opportunity.
 Poverty is the result of lack of opportunity.
 Poverty is the result of unfair distribution of wealth.

It is unclear if this is about individual poverty or structural poverty
or something else.  There are almost as many causes of individual
poverty as there are individuals.  One would really be cold hearted
to believe being in the wrong place at the wrong time was the
result of poor life choices.  Yeah, we could blame our nation's
cannon fodder for returning damaged from our wars.  Structural
poverty is more about the design of our systems to forward the
purposes of the ogliarchy.

Anyway, my dream of AI is the establishment of abundance
in all of our basic needs.  My fear is those who wish dominion
over the lives of others and already have it will fight against
freedom tooth and nail.  Since they have the means they will
probably win.
