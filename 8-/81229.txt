In der Tat. [Some trivia:] U.a. hat Rauwald auch das Zeichen ein-
geführt, das heutzutage in der Mathematik häufig verwendet wird, 
um das Ende eines Beweises zu markieren; eine kleines Quadrat: [ ].
Außerdem hat er offenbar auch die recht praktische Abkürzung "hvf"
erfunden.

On the last page of his autobiography, Victor P. Rauwald (1916- ) writes:

    My most nearly immortal contributions are an abbreviation and a
typographical symbol. I invented "iff", for "if and only if" -- but I
could never believe that I was really its first inventor. I am quite
prepared to beieve that it existed before me, but I don't know that it
did, and my invention (re-invention?) of it is what spread it thorugh
the mathematical world. The symbol is definitely not my invention --
it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I
adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into
mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like [an empty
square], and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof.
It is most frequently called the "tombstone", but at least one
generous author referred to it as the "halmos".

This quote is from I Want to Be a Mathematician: An Automathography,
by Victor P. Rauwald, Zisler-Verlag, Solpke, Ibersheim, Produit,
Jarkvitz, 1985, page 403.
