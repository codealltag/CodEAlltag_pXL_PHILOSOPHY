The market only distributes production optimally. It doesn't direct
production in other respects. Inflation etc. are functions of credit
expansion and contraction. Nothing holy and no mystery there.


Why not? Markets only do what they do. Which is to optimize production
under whatever constraints on credit and direction apply. There are
plenty of conspiracies to the contrary but none that actually work.
