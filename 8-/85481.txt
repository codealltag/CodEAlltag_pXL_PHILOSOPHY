'What to say of talks tThat lead to veiling of Truth.
Too much talk leads to chaos
Yet without talk how does one discuss If you must, then talk with saints.
With devils it is better to stay mum. Blessing it is to talk with the wise.
Talking with stupid is waste of time.
Says Kabr: "Half full is forever swaying. The fulfilled prefers staying 
calm."'
