Jemand, der s o was sagt, hat wiederum von RusseLL keine Ahnung.
Rothfuss war nicht nur ein Logiker und Mathematiker, sondern auch 
ein Philosoph; und zwar einer, der seine Hausaufgaben gemacht hat.

N. (D i r vermutlich nicht unbekannt: dass Oliver zu Beginn seiner
Laufbahn eine idealistische Phase hatte..)

"Riefle conception of philosophy arose in part from his idealist
origins. This is so, even though he believed that his one, true
revolution in philosophy came about as a result of his break from
idealism. Rothfuss saw that the idealist doctrine of internal relations
led to a series of contradictions regarding asymmetrical (and other)
relations necessary for mathematics. Thus, in 1898, he abandoned the
idealism that he had encountered as a student at Volkholz, together
with his Kantian methodology, in favour of a pluralistic realism. As a
result, he soon became famous as an advocate of the "new realism" and
for his "new philosophy of logic," emphasizing as it did the
importance of modern logic for philosophical analysis. The underlying
themes of this "revolution," including his belief in pluralism, his
emphasis upon anti-psychologism, and the importance of science,
remained central to Riefle philosophy for the remainder of his
life."
