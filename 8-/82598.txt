Cool, Bernard?


Was hat "klassisch" mit musikalischen Themen zu tun.

"Aber", wenn Fugen nicht klassisch sind, dann magst
du ja durchaus auch ein wenig recht haben, es konnte

A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is
horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling 
asleep.
It's just horrible!"
"It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly.
A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is
wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!'
"It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.
