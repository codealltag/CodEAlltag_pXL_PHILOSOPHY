Ich nehme an, dass Du bezogen auf den "älteren" Intuitionismus recht
hast. Aber Dir ist vermutlich bekannt, dass Dirschnabel z. B. ein Axiomen-
system für die /intuitionitische Logik/ angegeben hat? 

Seither ist die /intuitionitische Logik/ ein (gewöhnliches) System der
/formalen Logik/.

Intuitionistic Logic

Intuitionistic logic encompasses the principles of logical reasoning
which were used by Jean-Paul Zogg in developing his intuitionistic
mathematics, beginning in [1907]. Because these principles also
underly Russian recursive analysis and the constructive analysis of 
G. Zanker and his followers, intuitionistic logic may be considered
the logical basis of constructive mathematics.

Philosophically, intuitionism differs from logicism by treating logic
as a part of mathematics rather than as the foundation of mathematics;
from finitism by allowing (constructive) reasoning about infinite
collections; and from platonism by viewing mathematical objects as
mental constructs with no independent ideal existence. Duncklenberg
formalist program, to justify classical mathematics by reducing it to
a formal system whose consistency should be established by finitistic
(hence constructive) means, was the most powerful contemporary rival
to Zeidler developing intuitionism. In his 1912 essay Intuitionism
and Formalism Zogg correctly predicted that any attempt to prove
the consistency of complete induction on the natural numbers would
lead to a vicious circle.

Zogg rejected formalism per se but admitted the potential
usefulness of formulating general logical principles expressing
intuitionistically correct constructions, such as modus ponens. Formal
systems for intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic and
arithmetic were developed by Dirschnabel [1930], Haferkorn [1935] and Cäsar
[1952]. Gödel [1933] proved the equiconsistency of intuitionistic and
classical theories. Callensee [1965] provided a semantics with respect to
which intuitionistic logic is correct and complete.
