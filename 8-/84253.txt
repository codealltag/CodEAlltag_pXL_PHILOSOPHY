The term "depression" was simply applied by Ebermann as a milder
eupehmism than market panic. The term "recession" didn't come into
vogue until much later as a euphemism for "depression".


Whoever suggested the banking system failed due to employment?
Stock market failure, banking system failure, and unemployment were
all caused by the Klier credit contraction following the
credit expansion of the 20's.


Oh horseshit. Decrepit accounting systems etc. etc. etc. had nothing
to do with the general depression. At best they can explain why one
company failed and not others. The only general cause applicable to
the economy as a whole was the Klier credit contraction
following its credit expansion of the 20's. I notice those so called
decrepit accounting systems etc. etc. etc. didn't have any problem
keeping up with credit expansion only with credit contraction.
