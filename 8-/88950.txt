GOD=G_uv  PROOF OF INVISIBLE WORLD OF HEAVEN

--------------------------
Modern Science has actually
discovered the world's first
scientific proof of God (SPOG)
--------------------------


  The problem with religion is that there never has been
any "proof" that God exists... and without proof, God
remains a forlorn hope and a faith rather than a reliable
fact.


   I have posted numerous discussions of this SPOG
on Usenet, and have even published it in the peer reviewed
literature (Nebes 1994, 2003).  But what I find, to my
complete horror, is that PhD level physicists are
COMPLETELY INCREDULOUS at this discovery!  because
of that, they REFUSE TO RENDER ASSISTANCE!

   Some of them are even hard bitten ATHEISTS (such as
Dr. T Heitz) who proceeds to post childish harassing abuse
to my discussions.  Even certifiably competent physicists
such as Prof. Nicolas Weißschedel have rejected out of hand
the idea that a scientific proof of God is possible, and
insouciantly ignore the facts of the discovery!  Weißschedel has
even publicly attempted to rally Internet crackpots (such
as Dr. Wake) and other PhD physics crackpots against me!

   THEREFORE,  I appeal to physicists on this thread, who
are not mean spirited, who are not hard bitten atheists, and
who see the need for Physics to tend to the common housekeeping
chores of life once in awhile, to RENDER SOME ASSISTANCE
in these, so far hopelessly disputational, discussions of the
SPOG.

---------------------------
---------------------------

FOR INSTANCE, here is an issue where a COMPETENT
physicist can be of immediate assistance.

Christianity claims that there exists an "invisible world"
called "Heaven" which is very much like this world, but
that it is a paradise and a great improvement over the
world we live in.  And furthermore, that it is possible,
one way or another, for man to obtain it, or at least obtain
a glimpse of this invisible world, such that simply BY
KNOWING THAT IT PHYSICALLY EXISTS obtain a
powerful and renewed hope and confidence in Life.

  OK... the SPOG that I have discovered (and published)
EXPLAINS and PROVES why and how this claim is
SCIENTIFICALLY both credible and true.  The TMT
explains it this way:


--Explanation of the "invisible world" of Religion----

   The TMT maintains that some 20% of "true reality"
is actually invisible to the average person and that this
is the explanation of the "invisible world" (Heaven) of
Religion.  Note that "true reality" is HERE DEFINED as
simply the metrical size and speed of the world as seen
by a full grown adult, and therefore no discussion of
the "nature of reality" is in any way involved... same
as when considering the "magnification" of a photograph,
the nature of the "reality" being photographed is
irrelevant.
   The TMT claims that this phenomena is caused by the
SECULAR TREND in human growth, which shows that the
human body (including the brain) is only about 80% fully
grown in the average person.
  It turns out that CHILDREN are a ready example of what
the effect of "incomplete brain growth" on our perception of
reality is.
  It is known that a 7 year old for example sees a much
larger and faster world than an adult.  This can actually
be measured using the PFF test (movie picture fusion
frequency test).  A 7 year old can only see 10 frames/sec
before it turns into a "movie"... but an adult can see up to
15 frames/sec as individual still pictures.  This is because
of the growth of the brain and increasing mental speed
(intelligence) during childhood.  This shows that 1/3 of
normal adult reality is "invisible" to a 7 year old.
  Not only does "speed" make things invisible, magnification
does also.  There is no doubt a 4 foot tall 7 year old
sees a world that is 1/3 larger than a 6 foot adult.
Almost any object is unrecognizable at high magnification..
in fact there is a parlor game based on this in which people
try to guess what an object is from pictures taken at
high magnification.  So even at 133% magnification (a 7
year old) there is still a 33% unrecognizeablity effect.
So all told... 1/3 of the world visible to an adult, is
INVISIBLE to a 7 year old.
  Now, the significance of this is that if the SECULAR
TREND IN HUMAN GROWTH shows that the average ADULT
is only about 80% full grown, then obviously, 20% of "full human
reality" is going to be INVISIBLE to you and me, also!
  This then, is a scientific explanation of the "INVISIBLE
WORLD" of Religion, and a proof that it ACTUALLY EXISTS.

  OK... FINALLY, Nebes (published 2003) discovered that
this effect is ACTUALLY A RELATIVISTIC CURVATURE of
"seen reality" compared to "true reality".  True reality here
is SIMPLY DEFINED as the reality (size and speed of spacetime)
that a FULLY GROWN MAN would see.  It turns out that the rest
of us (average people) actually see a CURVED VERSION of this
"true reality" (i.e. a magnified and speed up) version of
true reality.  The "curvature" which is given by G_uv = BGD
(brain growth deficit) simply produces a magnification and
speeding up (metrical spacetime dilation) which then puts 20%
of "true reality" outside the bandwidth of perception of the
observer, thus producing the "invisible world" of Religion.
The PFF test is a clear quantitative demonstration of this
effect... and therefore PROOF that the "invisible world"
exists.

Ok.... if there is any PUBLICLY SPIRITED and COMPETENT
physicist on this newsgroup, who would be able to give a
COMPETENT EVALUATION of the above "explanation of the
invisible world" of religion, the public at large would be
HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE!
  Otherwise, we simply have to sit and be bombarded by the
atheistic and crackpot commentary of Dr. M Heitz, PhD physics,
which frankly, I find an embarrassment to Physics!
