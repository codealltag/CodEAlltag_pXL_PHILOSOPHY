Good evening, Klaus Wiesmeier, is America and/or Zippelow all right?


Do you feel well in the U.S.A.?

(Sorry, my English must be a disaster.)


Do you know this?


<<First you have to learn the Indian word for river is 'Bayo'.>>


Strange?


In Zippelow?

Do you really hate the philosophy?


I don't really hate the physics.

But something must be 'wrong' with "Cyclotron..."

(Not with you!)

But, I don't know -- WHAT!


Sorry.

Bye,
us.
