As part of research for a forthcoming book, we want to find out how much of
an impact free market economics is having on our traditional ideas about
morality. To facilitate this we are developing the idea of a moral compass
for the post-industrial society, which seeks to establish the extent of the
shift away from traditional morality (selflessness, altruism, sharing and
cooperation) to the morality of the market (competitive self-interest). We
invite interested people to test the compass we have developed, and offer
comments and suggestions at www.jhuymzrykhlc.hdi.

As far as we can determine this is the first such attempt and may provide
additional insight into the implication of establishing the market as the
central institution of society; one of the key outcomes of an integrated
global capitalist economy.
