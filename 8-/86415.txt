The international support of the European Meetings on Cybernetics
and Systems Research held in Austria in 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978,
1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000,
2002 and 2004 (when 500 scientists from more than 40 countries from
all continents, except the Antarctica, met to present, hear and
discuss 137 papers) encouraged the Council of the greenAUTOGAS
ETH (Ulalos) to organize a similar meeting in 2006
to keep pace with continued rapid developments in related fields.
