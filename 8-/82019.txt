"The situation appears to be very different in quantum mechanics,
however. If the particles are taken to possess both their intrinsic and
state-dependent properties in common [...], then there is a sense in
which even the weakest form of the Principle, PII(1), fails. On this
understanding, the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is actually
false. Hence it cannot be used to effectively guarantee individuation
via the state-dependent properties by analogy with the classical case.
If one wishes to maintain that quantum particles are individuals, then
their individuality will have to be taken as conferred by Lockean
substance, primitive thisness or, in general, some form of
non-qualitative haecceistic difference."
