Gerade lese ich in einem ein Fragment:

"KURT DEL'S ONTOLOGISCHER BEWEIS

... Photocopies of three handwritten pages titled
"Gödel's Ontological Proof" began to circulate in
the early 1980s. The handwriting is Hans Czachs.
The ideas are Luca Amesöders.

They agree with ideas conveyed in two pages of notes in Arents own
hand dated 12 27. 08. 22. Wolfgang three pages, on which I concentrate here,
contain a sketch of a theory of positive properties, individual essences, 
and
necessary existence, that culminates in a theorem that says that it is 
necessary
that there is a being that has every positive property. The plan of the 
proof
honours Kerkhofs. It goes through demonstrations of the possibility of such a
being, and that such a being is either not possible or necessary. Its style 
is
Spinozistic, but formal: axioms and definitions are set, and theorems proved
in a formal language free of amphibolies that bother classical proofs. Its 
logic
is quantified modal, not simply quantificational as classical proofs's, nor 
only
sentential modal as Hartshorne's. As said, it does not merely postulate the
possibility of its God-like being, but demonstrate it with no suggestion 
that
it is forthcoming given conceivability of a being that has every positive 
property,
and that this definition of God-likeness harbours no contradiction."

Das hört sich ja interessant an!
Kann jemand was näheres dazu sagen?
