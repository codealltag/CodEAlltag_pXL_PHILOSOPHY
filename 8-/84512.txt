Unglaublich, da schreibt jemand tatsächlich folgendes,
und er ist ein führender Physiker unserer Zeit. Vielleicht
kann das bitte mal jemand übersetzen?

"Modern theoretical physics is difficult to understand for anyone
outside the subject. Can philosophers really contribute to the
project of reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory?
Or is this a technical business best left to the experts? I would argue
for the former. General relativity and quantum field theory are based
on some profound insights about the nature of reality. These insights
are crystallized in the form of mathematics, but there is a limit to how
much progress we can make by just playing around with this mathematics.
We need to go back to the insights behind general relativity and quantum
field theory, learn to hold them together in our minds, and dare to imagine
a world more strange, more beautiful, but ultimately more reasonable
than our current theories of it. For this daunting task, philosophical
reflection is bound to be of help."
