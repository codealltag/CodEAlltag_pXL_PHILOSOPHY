That would be nice.


It's about the economic design of capitalism which has it's 
virtues and built in flaws.  Inflation, over and underproduction,
and the business cycle of boom and bust are historical realities.
Or are you a true believer in the holy perfection of the market system?


So true.


I was the opposite. I respected authority and trusted in
the wisdom and benevolence of my 'betters'.


We meet again Jean-Luc. Hi there. I used to be humble, but it wore off.
Now that I'm old I finally see that the old have no corner on wisdom
and no right to respect that they don't actually earn.  I've been to
college too, and found that there are idiots with degrees.  Now
I grant no virtues to authority unless they actually show some.
Everyone's entitled to an opinion but that doesn't make them right.
So we continue to disagree.
