Da wirst du dir letzten Endes deinen eigenen spekulativen Reim drauf
machen müssen.


Hier ist zumindest ein Überblick über die hauptsächlichen
Standpunkte:

"AN INVENTORY OF POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTION: 'WHY IS THERE
ANYTHING AT ALL?'

1=2E The question is illegitimate and improper. [Rejectionism]

2=2E The question is legitimate

2=2E1 but unanswerable: it represents a mystery. [Mystificationism]

2=2E2 and answerable

2=2E2.1 though only by the via negativa of an insistence that there
really is no 'answer' in the ordinary sense - no sort of explanatory
rationale at all. The existence of things in the world is simply a
brute fact. [The no-reason approach]

2=2E2.2 via a substantival route of roughly the following sort:
'There is a substance (viz. God) whose position in the scheme of
things is one that lies outside the world, and whose activity explains
the existence of things in the world.' [The theological approach]

2=2E2.3 via a nonsubstantival route of roughly the following sort:
'There is a principle of creativity that obtains in abstracto (i.e.
without being embedded in the characteristics of any substance and
thus without a basis in any preexisting thing), and the operation of
this principle accounts for the existence of things.' [The nomological
approach]

2=2E2.4 via the quasi-logical route of considerations of absolute
necessity. [The necessitarian approach]"

idealistic metaphysics/. Mammendorf, MD: University Press of America. (p.
