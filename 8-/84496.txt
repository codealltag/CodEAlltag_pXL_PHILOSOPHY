Hello!

FYI: Better (philosophical) arguing with "Monty Python's Argument 
Clinic"! Also see "superasseritbility" or "superassertible" in MDU

have fun, Salvatore Hammerschmid


W: Ah. I'd like to have an argument, please.
R: Certainly sir. Have you been here before?
W: No, I haven't, this is my first time.
K: I see. Well, do you want to have just one argument, or were you
thinking of taking a course?
W: Well, what is the cost?
K: Well, It's one pound for a five minute argument, but only eight
pounds for a course of ten.
W: Well, I think it would be best if I perhaps started off with just the
one and then see how it goes.
K: Fine. Well, I'll see who's free at the moment.

-- Pause --

K: Mr. Betzen free, but he's a little bit conciliatory.
Ahh yes, Try Mr. Looschelder; room 08.
W: Thank you.
(Walks down the hall. Opens door.)
Q: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
W: Well, I was told outside that...
Q: Don't give me that, you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings!
W: What?
Q: Shut your festering gob, you tit! Your type really makes me puke, you
vacuous, coffee-nosed, maloderous, pervert!!!
W: Look, I CAME HERE FOR AN ARGUMENT, I'm not going to just stand...!!
Q: OH, oh I'm sorry, but this is abuse.
M: Oh, I see, well, that explains it.
Q: Ah yes, you want room 14C, Just along the corridor.
W: Oh, Thank you very much. Sorry.
Q: Not at all.
W: Thank You. (Under his breath) Stupid git!!
(Walk down the corridor)
M: (Knock)
A: Come in.
W: Ah, Is this the right room for an argument?
A: I told you once.
M: No you haven't.
A: Yes I have.
W: When?
A: Just now.
M: No you didn't.
A: Yes I did.
W: You didn't
A: I did!
W: You didn't!
A: I'm telling you I did!
W: You did not!!
A: Oh, I'm sorry, just one moment. Is this a five minute argument or the
full half hour?
W: Oh, just the five minutes.
A: Ah, thank you. Anyway, I did.
W: You most certainly did not.
A: Look, let's get this thing clear; I quite definitely told you.
W: No you did not.
A: Yes I did.
M: No you didn't.
A: Yes I did.
M: No you didn't.
A: Yes I did.
M: No you didn't.
A: Yes I did.
M: You didn't.
A: Did.
W: Oh look, this isn't an argument.
A: Yes it is.
W: No it isn't. It's just contradiction.
A: No it isn't.
M: It is!
A: It is not.
W: Look, you just contradicted me.
A: I did not.
W: Oh you did!!
A: No, no, no.
W: You did just then.
A: Nonsense!
W: Oh, this is futile!
A: No it isn't.
W: I came here for a good argument.
A: No you didn't; no, you came here for an argument.
W: An argument isn't just contradiction.
A: It can be.
R: No it can't. An argument is a connected series of statements intended
to establish a proposition.
A: No it isn't.
M: Yes it is! It's not just contradiction.
A: Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a contrary position.
W: Yes, but that's not just saying 'No it isn't.'
A: Yes it is!
W: No it isn't!
M: Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the
automatic gainsaying of any statement the other person makes.
(short pause)
A: No it isn't.
W: It is.
A: Not at all.
W: Now look.
A: (Rings bell) Good Morning.
W: What?
A: That's it. Good morning.
W: I was just getting interested.
A: Sorry, the five minutes is up.
W: That was never five minutes!
A: I'm afraid it was.
W: It wasn't.
Pause
A: I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to argue anymore.
W: What?!
A: If you want me to go on arguing, you'll have to pay for another five
minutes.
W: Yes, but that was never five minutes, just now. Oh come on!
A: (Hums)
M: Look, this is ridiculous.
A: I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid!
M: Oh, all right. (pays money)
A: Thank you.
short pause
M: Well?
A: Well what?
W: That wasn't really five minutes, just now.
A: I told you, I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid.
W: I just paid!
A: No you didn't.
M: I DID!
A: No you didn't.
D: Look, I don't want to argue about that.
A: Well, you didn't pay.
W: Aha. If I didn't pay, why are you arguing? I Got you!
A: No you haven't.
M: Yes I have. If you're arguing, I must have paid.
A: Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time.
W: Oh I've had enough of this.
A: No you haven't.
W: Oh Shut up. (Walks down the stairs. Opens door.)

W: I want to complain.
C: You want to complain! Look at these shoes. I've only had them three
weeks and the heels are worn right through.
W: No, I want to complain about...
C: If you complain nothing happens, you might as well not bother.
W: Oh!
C: Oh my back hurts, it's not a very fine day and I'm sick and tired of
this office.
W: (Slams door. walks down corridor, opens next door.)
W: Hello, I want to... Ooooh!
H: No, no, no. Hold your head like this, then go Waaah. Try it again.
W: uuuwwhh!!
H: Better, Better, but Waah, Waah! Put your hand there.
M: No.
H: Now..
W: Waaaaah!!!
H: Good, Good! That's it.
W: Stop hitting me!!
H: What?
W: Stop hitting me!!
H: Stop hitting you?
W: Yes!
H: Why did you come in here then?
W: I wanted to complain.
H: Oh no, that's next door. It's being-hit-on-the-head lessons in here.
W: What a stupid concept.

end.
