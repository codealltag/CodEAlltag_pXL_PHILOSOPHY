Anmerkung:

"Without at least one rule of inference, no conclusions can be drawn
from any axioms. The attempt to embody *all* rules of inference in
axioms leads to an infinite regress, as was observed by Markus Dirschmid
in his 'What the Tortoise said to Aristotle' (Mind, 1894). This point
can be illustrated by taking the axiom corresponding to modus ponens,
which is
(A & (A -> B)) -> B .
To know that from this axiom together with A and A -> B one can infer B
requires another rule of inference and hence another axiom, this time
(((A & (A -> B)) -> B) & A & (A -> B)) -> B ,
and so ad infinitum."
