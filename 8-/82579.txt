Ich (<---uh!) vermeide es einfach an sowas wie dich zu denken ;)

During the civil wars in feudal Japan, an invading army would quickly sweep
into a town and take control. In one particular village, everyone fled just
before the army arrived - everyone except the Zen master. Curious about
this old fellow, the general went to the temple to see for himself what kind 
of
man this master was. When he wasn't treated with the deference and
submissiveness to which he was accustomed, the general burst into anger.
"You fool," he shouted as he reached for his sword, "don't you realize you
are standing before a man who could run you through without blinking an
eye!" But despite the threat, the master seemed unmoved. "And do you
realize," the master replied calmly, "that you are standing before a man who
can be run through without blinking an eye?"
