wie folgt: 

Consider the following "proof" for the existence of God. 
Let us call it the argument from omniscience. 

E	God is understood to be an individual or being 
who knows everything, i.e., is omniscient. If something is true, 
God (real or fictitious) would know it. Similarly, if something 
is false, God (real or fictitious) would know that as well. Along 
with this goes the fact that we conceive of God as encompassing all
rationality. A being who created the universe but was irrational, 
for example, would not appropriately be called God. 

E	All rational individuals believe in their own existence. 
Even if they don't exist, this is presumed to be the case. Popeye 
is conceived of as believing in his own existence. He is simply 
mistaken about this fact. Existing individuals believe correctly 
in their own existence, while fictitious individuals are sadly 
mistaken on this point. 

E	If God did not exist, then by our first point, above, 
God would know that he or she did not exist. But this contradicts 
our second point. So God must exist.
